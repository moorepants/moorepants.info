<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<p>I would like to join an educational institution that encourages, sustains, and
nurtures non-traditional engineering education models. The traditional
engineering education process is roughly:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Students sit through two years of lectures on fundamentals: calculus,
physics, chemistry, etc. (also known as the &quot;weeder&quot; courses).</li>
<li>After the foundational knowledge has been gained, the students sit through
one to two more years of specialized engineering lectures.</li>
<li>Finally, as a capstone in the last year the student is tasked with working
on a research or industrial project where they apply all of their knowledge
from their previous lectures. This may or may not be a team project.</li>
</ol>
<p>This educational model has its strengths and has served us well but it also has
many drawbacks. The students have to sit through at least three years of
lectures before they ever really get to be engineers. What we have to realize
is that engineers are not defined by their course credit hours and their GPAs;
rather they are defined by their ability to innovate and solve practical
problems. On day one of university, students have the potential to solve
complex world problems and we should let them. Approaching the subject matter
from disjoint building blocks is not necessarily the way to hook students and
get them excited about the major. Richard Miller of Olin college often draws an
analogy between engineering students and violin students. Can you imagine not
playing the violin until your fourth year of study? Violinists start making
sounds with their instrument the first day of lessons. Why do we create an
environment that makes it difficult for students to realize what an engineer
actually is? Students are capable of creating and engineering from day one and
we should nurture and promote that. Instead of weeding away the students, we
should build their capacity and love for engineering. We should make their
entire experience (especially the first year!) full of fun and exciting
projects, that leave them begging for the knowledge and tools we usually have
to force upon them. Many of the students in a traditional engineering
curriculum only come to know and understand the essence of engineering by doing
extracurricular projects. For example, my involvement with national engineering
competitions early in my undergraduate studies was the trigger for me to care
about what was being taught in class.  Why don't we bring this into the
classroom from the start and for <em>all</em> students?</p>
<p>We as engineers are often lectured at with little interaction in class, little
discussion, little team work, and little connection to the &quot;real&quot; world. In
many cases, this is very unfortunate because the world, whether industry or
academia, is a collaborative environment that offers a multitude of learning
avenues. In the &quot;real&quot; world we discuss, we work together, we solve real
problems. Why not make the classroom the real world, instead of pretending it
is separate? There is no reason students cannot tackle actual problems early in
their education. Few people can make extraordinary impacts in engineering on
their own, but many groups of people make great impacts each and every day. I
am a strong advocate for collaborative interactive classrooms and I work hard
to create that setting. I also will hard to start students early solving actual
problems sourced from research and industry.</p>
<p>So far, my teaching experience is based on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>teaching a large undergraduate engineering course at UC Davis</li>
<li>the four teaching assistantships I've had in the UC Davis MAE department,</li>
<li>my work mentoring 15+ graduate and undergraduate students in a lab setting</li>
<li>supervising and teaching students in the UC Davis engineering machine shop</li>
<li>leading workshop series at the Davis Bike Collective on bicycle repair over 7
years</li>
<li>leading action research teams for the Education for UCD Sustainable Living
course</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these I have been exposed to a variety conventional and
non-conventional teaching paradigms built on collaborative education, high
standards, and engaging students with a variety of learning styles and
backgrounds. For example, my teaching through the Davis Bike Collective has
built my aptitude for individualized hands off teaching for 10-20 students at a
time while each student is working on their individual project. I can make use
of combinations of kinesthetic, auditory, visual, and example based teaching
and rapidly assess the student's intake and adjust teaching styles as needed.
Since my resume details these efforts, I'll only further touch on the most
recent course I have taught to demonstrate my classroom teaching experience.</p>
<p>I have taught an introductory class on three dimensional thinking, engineering
graphics, design, and computer-aided design both as the lead lecturer and as a
teaching assistant. The course materials and details can be found on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~biosport/jkm/courses/eng4">course website</a>.</p>
<p>This was a class of about 120 students; most were freshman and the course is
promoted as a good introductory class to mechanical engineering. I organized
the class much as it was previously taught by another professor, with two hours
of lecture per week and a three-hour 30 person laboratory led by four TAs. I
was responsible for creating the curriculum for both the class and lab. I
encouraged TAs to work together to develop teaching materials for lab sessions
around the curriculum design. It is difficult to have a very interactive
classroom with 100+ students, but I made use of regular short group assignments
during class to have students engage with and learn from their neighbors. I
also used a combination of visual materials and in-class sketching examples to
explain concepts. Students were assigned weekly readings and sketching along
with homework assignments to develop their mastery of that week's material. The
lab and lectures functioned somewhat independently, but were designed to
reinforce each other. The most difficult process was teaching students how to
think visually, especially if they hadn't done so before. Lots of office hour
time was spent working with students that had difficulties. I also kept a
strong focus on drawing and sketching in the lecture sections, as I still see
it as a fundamental skill for design. But the labs focused much more strongly
on computer aided visualization and design. Sketching and drawing by hand
remains one of the most effective ways of transferring and formalizing ideas
and shapes from ones mind. Some of the other teaching methods and tools I
implemented and used are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Developing three-dimensional thinking through sketching.</li>
<li>Administered two comprehensive in-class exams.</li>
<li>In-class small-group problem solving assignments (sketching).</li>
<li>All lecture notes were posted online after each lecture with reuse
permissions where possible.</li>
<li>I developed a good portion of the visual materials myself, borrowed the rest
from permissive online resources, and filled in the rest from the class text
book.</li>
<li>I developed an extensive course website with syllabus, tutorials, and extra
class-related info.</li>
<li>Use of the Sakai (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/">http://www.sakaiproject.org/</a>) UCD software implementation
to interact with and share materials with the students. This included email
communication and chat room communication.</li>
<li>Online assignment submission and grading to reduce dealing with paper.</li>
<li>Regular office hours sessions for small group learning and appointments for
individual meetings.</li>
<li>I worked closely with the TAs to help them develop their lab sessions and
teaching skills with weekly feedback to keep track of student progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>My student reviews of the class revealed that most recommended the class and
many found the class to be a positive reinforcement of their choice of major.
85% of the students felt the course and my teaching were good overall. My major
weaknesses were the over use of slide shows and the ability to make the
lectures fun.</p>
<p>If I were to teach the course again I would change these aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I'd incorporate 3D printing in the class and create hand held objects for
each student to touch and see for explanation of 3D concepts.</li>
<li>Move away from slide shows by creating large props and designing more 3D
interactive computer examples to explain concepts.</li>
<li>Begin the development of my own text book material.</li>
<li>Devote more class time to collaborative small-group learning and exercises,
leaving more of the lecture material for out of class reading or lecture
videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final sections below detail some other aspects of teaching that I plan
to incorporate and include some class designs for undergraduates and
graduates.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collaborative-teaching">
<h2>Collaborative Teaching</h2>
<p>I am interested in collaborative teaching efforts, as a good team of teachers
will often complement each other and exceed what is provided by a singleton.
Yes, teachers all have their individual styles but this is no reason not to
harness the resources from many teachers to teach the same course while
developing plans, materials, etc. I would like to develop and foster
collaborative teaching groups in courses that span not only our small
departments, but across other colleges around the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grades">
<h2>Grades</h2>
<p>Individual performance and scholastic aptitude are certainly a way to evaluate
someone's potential, but traditional grading derived from tests and assignments
fails to measure many of the other qualities that make successful engineers.
The undergraduate experience is highly focused on individual grades.  The
successful students, in terms of our grade measure, are the ones who figure out
how to optimize their behavior for obtaining the highest grade. This
optimization does not necessarily include the aspects of engineering that we
really want to get across to students. Where possible, I'm for more qualitative
measures of a student's success and would not complain at all if traditional
grades could be left out of the picture altogether.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology">
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Expanding teaching techniques and the freedom to be experimental are high
priorities for me. Students continue to absorb and learn in new ways faster
that we can keep up with. One of importance is through modern technology. I am
an advocate of utilizing technology in and out of the classroom for
collaboration and interactive learning. These methods range from social media
and collaborative software to class polling and open accessible content. I plan
to make strong use of these latest tools in the classroom, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>clicker feedback in classroom</li>
<li>interactive websites</li>
<li>maintaing a class blog</li>
<li>exploration of massive open online courses (MOOCS)</li>
<li>video podcasts</li>
<li>class wikis</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learning-to-teach">
<h2>Learning to teach</h2>
<p>PhD students in engineering are typically not taught how to teach. We are
measured on our research and scholastic capabilities but not on our teaching
abilities, so our time is spent learning how to do the former rather than the
later. This is quite unfortunate because many of us are expected to be good
teachers in our post graduate careers. We've all had horrible teachers in our
undergraduate curriculum and these are a product of a broken system. This means
that if we want to be great or even just good teachers we have a lot to learn
and we must do this on the job and through extra-curricular learning
opportunities. Workshops, readings, collaborative teaching, and mentor-mentee
relationships will be a core part of my continuing education on education to
make up for the gaps in my skill set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="text-books">
<h2>Text books</h2>
<p>Expensive text books in which a new version is published every year will become
a thing of the past. The average semester/quarter cost of engineering text
books for a student can range from $300-$600. The publishing industry has made
this whole system a scam for both the students and the authors, with the
publishers reaping all the benefits. This basic knowledge that undergraduates
learn, should be available in an open and accessible form for no cost.
Wikipedia has shown us the power of the masses to create and maintain the most
authoritative text on the world's subjects. This should be no different for
fundamental text books. The classes I teach will be accompanied by a
collaboratively created text book that will morph and change throughout the
years. The materials will be created by both the teachers and the students and
will not be limited by what can be put on paper, but will take advantage of the
power of the world wide web and the latest internet technologies. Successful
examples of things of this nature include UC Davis's <a class="reference external" href="http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/">ChemWiki</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://nanohub.org">NanoHub</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wikibooks.org">WikiBooks</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-based-learning">
<h2>Project Based Learning</h2>
<p>Young students have a deep reservoir for passion and we as teachers should help
that flourish as early in the engineering curriculum as possible. One way to do
this is to give students real-life problems to solve and have them use the
power of team work to create and innovate solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-ideas">
<h2>Course Ideas</h2>
<p>I am interested in teaching many classes. I am well equipped to teach
undergraduate courses in dynamics, control, bio-mechanics, vehicle dynamics,
mixed system dynamics with bond graphs, and aircraft dynamics but am adaptable
and open to any courses in a general mechanical engineering curriculum. I also
have a personal interest in developing undergraduate programming and software
development skills at a early stage. I believe that most engineering curricula
gloss over these skills, leaving students to flounder and develop extremely
poor programming practices, even though engineers are called on to analyze data
and to be experts in scientific computing. An early start at good practices in
programming will save large amounts of time in the future and set students up
to be marketable for the web generation.</p>
<p>As far a graduate classes are concerned, I am interested in teaching advanced
multi-body dynamics, in particular developing students' knowledge of Kane’s
method and using symbolic computational software for efficient derivation of
symbolic equations of motion. I have been involved in the development of
software to do this and have plans to engage students in software design and
development in this area. I believe that the engineering curriculum is often
weak in the development of statistical analyses for experiments. I would like
to teach a course on design of experiments that will give graduate students the
tools and know-how to work with the massive amounts of experimental data that
inevitably carries with it much error. I would also like to teach a graduate
level version of software design for science. Big data is at our door step and
engineers will need to be able to deal with big data to solve the next
generation of engineering problems. Good system identification courses are
often hard to come by. I'd like to develop one that is founded and linked to
machine learning and big data problems.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am interested in developing a course modeled after a colleague in
Spain that centers on the bicycle. The bicycle is an interestingly rich
dynamics and control problem and is a familiar object to most people. The class
would be designed to emulate the scientific process, essentially provided a
canned, but complex, dynamic system to model, measure, and validate with
experimentation. The bicycle offers an economical and tractable platform for
learning the whole picture in experimentation which is perfect for a
undergraduate or graduate level course.</p>
<div class="section" id="reproducible-scientific-computing">

<p>This class will introduce students to modern scientific data analysis which is
structured around reproducible computational workflows. Large amounts of data
are often overwhelming and managing that data becomes cumbersome and error
prone with commonly learned computational tools.Topics will include version
control, databases, unit testing, reproducible software, the unix shell,
Python, R, BASH, regular expressions, data types, object oriented programming,
Make, matrix programming, scientific document creation, and sharing data
through the web. The class will also delve into general topics in Open Science
and what role massive sharing of data, code, and literature will play in the
future. Students will come away with a broad toolset for managing data and
software at the research level along with new ideas related to open science.
Students will be responsible for creating a complete computationally
reproducible project based on real data and sharing it via the web.</p>
