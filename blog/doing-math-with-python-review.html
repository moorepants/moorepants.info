<p>I had the pleasure of reviewing Amit Saha's book &quot;Doing Math with Python&quot; over
the Christmas break and this post contains the email I sent to Amit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amit,</p>
<p>I had a chance to go through the book today. I really enjoyed it and think
you've done a great job with it. I thought it was easily to follow and the
use of fun examples that drive the motivation of each topic is great. I've
been trying to convince my brother who is a high school mathematics teacher
in Virginia to learn and introduce mathematical programming for his class but
he hasn't bitten yet. I think this book could convince him. It is hard for me
to remember my head space in high school, but this seems appropriately
scoped, as long as you've got some basic programming concepts under your
belt. With that said, I think a &quot;Chapter Zero&quot; on the basics of Python
programming could make the book usable for students that don't quite have the
programming background. Here are a few other notes I took:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I like that you use the most up-to-date Python 3 idioms, especially
.format()</li>
<li>The introduction of Counter with no conceptual base of the difference in
classes, functions, and methods could be confusing. But maybe it is ok just
to throw it out there and not explain it, as the overhead of the details
could be too much.</li>
<li>I would have liked to see some explanation of text files. Many students
have no idea what it means to edit a text file. It would be nice if
Anaconda came with a simple cross platform text editor that you could
present.</li>
<li>It wasn't clear to me why the gravitational example on page 129 was
relevant to the chapter on sets.</li>
<li>I was curious why you chose to use SymPy sets over Python sets. If it is
possible to do everything in the book with Python sets, maybe that would be
lower overhead.</li>
<li>I loved seeing all the uses of SymPy and the great introduction to the
software.</li>
<li>I'd recommend making a simple conda package for your Venn diagram package
so that you only need one install command.</li>
<li>I loved that the installation process was so simple, thanks to Anaconda,
but you could also think about showing Sagemathcloud as an option to
installing things (SMC comes with text editors).</li>
<li>I know color printing is expensive, but there is educational evidence that
syntax highlighting helps learning. Maybe it could be an option in the
future printings.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, like I said, really nice work! The book is a great introduction to doing
math with Python. I hope that high school teachers find it and see its utility.
I'll spread the word the best I can.</p>
<p>Thanks for writing the book and sharing with me. Also thanks for all the SymPy
participation. I hope to see you around the mailing lists and Github in the
future.</p>
<p>Jason</p>
