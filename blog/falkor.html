    <div class="content">
      <p>Yumi and I have two great friends, Aubrey and Kent, and they got hitched in mid
May. Kent is a <a class="reference external" href="http://davisbikecollective.org/">bike minister</a> and when he saw the tandem I'd recently
acquired he asked if Aubrey and he could ride it as part of their wedding. I
was happy to oblige but I quickly realized that the tandem in its current state
was not worthy of the wedding it would participate in. Yumi and I brainstormed
turning it into a horse or unicorn but during our search for other bicycles
that had been transformed into four legged creatures we came across an image of
a <a class="reference external" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BAFx85ACYAA9-p0.jpg">Falkor-shaped bicycle</a>. The image of Kent and Aubrey astride a Falkor
tandem was too amazing to turn away so we started figuring out how to make the
dream come true. This post details how we built Falkor over two days and some
weekday evenings with the help of several friends: Johnny, Antonia, and
Charlie.</p>

<h2>Build Description</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" class="img-rounded" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-01.jpg" />
<p class="caption">We were able to find a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.123dapp.com/3dcr-Creature/Falcor-the-Luck-Dragon/1502912">3D model of a Falkor</a> in STL format online. I
loaded this in FreeCAD (which took forever due to the number of nodes) and
sliced it into cross sections that proportionally ensured the correct width
of the actual head given the 1/2&quot; foam board. We projected these cross
sections onto the foam board and traced them ensuring that the there were
some reference marks for proper alignment after they were all cut.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-02.jpg" />
<p class="caption">We used long razor knives to cut out the cross sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-03.jpg" />
<p class="caption">This shot shows the layers stacked up (not quite properly aligned) and the
eye balls which were made from a dollar store plastic coconut bra and
painted with nail polish.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-04.jpg" />
<p class="caption">At this point we'd been debating how to mount the head, either on the frame
or on the fork/handlebar assembly. To determine if the mass would make
steering too difficult we duct taped the head to a front mounted rack and
gave it a whirl. The inertia of the head definitely increases the difficulty
when starting but it works well enough to get around.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-05.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Antonia and Yumi glued the foam board together using foam board glue. The
spokes were punched through the reference marks to ensure proper alignment.
The seems to take at least two days to actually cure so we had some problems
handling it the next day and had to often realign the layers when they were
out of place.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-06.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The head was glued together in three sections. In the middle section we
installed wooden dowels for secure attachment points to the front rack.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-07.jpg" />
<p class="caption">With all of the head sections glued together the head is starting to look
more like Falkor.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-08.jpg" />
<p class="caption">We then sanded the foam on the head to blend in all of the cross sections.
Heavy grit sand paper did a great job at this except for the fact that we
didn't remove the film on both sides of the foam board. We removed most of
the metallic film but didn't think to remove the translucent film and it
prevented us from completely hiding the cross section seams.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-09.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Once sanded, the facial features start to stand out.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-10.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Johnny had the idea to bring the eyelids to life, which I was reluctant to
pursue. But I couldn't get the idea out of my head and worked out that it
wouldn't be too hard to implement. We installed some wall board anchors into
the foam to act as a hinge point and shaped a spoke into the edge of the
eyelid. We also carved grooves into the head for the shifter cable and cable
housing which would function as the actuators.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-11.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Antonia covered the eyelids with our Falkor skin (dollar store car chamois).</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-12.jpg" />
<p class="caption">We decided to cover most of the head with the chamois, except for the nose
and forehead. Antonia hand shaped the nostrils and covered it with some
light paper mache and white paint.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-13.jpg" />
<p class="caption">With the nose and eyes defined, the head started to really look like Falkor.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-14.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The eyes are independently controlled by a stem tube shifter that is mounted
on the back of the head. To create a cable housing stop I inserted a stout
piece of sheet metal into the foam and glued it in place. I then soldered
the end of the shifter cable to a small nut that was slid over the eyelid
rim. This allowed the shifter to pull and push the eyelids open and closed,
respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-eyes.gif" />
<p class="caption">The eyes in operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-15.jpg" />
<p class="caption">At this point Yumi covered the head in fur and created brows and a mustache.
The nostrils were accented with black paint and the forehead was paper
machete'd and painted as pink scales. She also detailed the mouth to give
Falkor teeth and a slight grin.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-16.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The last major touch was to attach the ears that Antonia sewed to the sides
of the head.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-17.jpg" />
<p class="caption">We then attached the head to the front mounted rack using plenty of zip
ties. The rack and head assembly can be removed from the bicycle by four
bolts.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-18.jpg" />
<p class="caption">We covered the top tube with shredded fabric.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-19.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Here is the attached fabric and the pool noodle we used to support the tail.
There is a wooden dowel in the pool noodle to give it some structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-20.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Antonia and Yumi carved the haunches by hand out of some leftover foam.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-21.jpg" />
<p class="caption">We used zip ties and dowels to attach the haunches.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/falkor-22.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The tail was covered in fabric and the rump was built up with pool noodle
chunks and then covered too.</p>
</div>
