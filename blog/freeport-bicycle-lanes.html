<img alt="Image of bicyclist on Freeport Blvd in Sacramento" class="img-rounded" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/sacbee-freeport.jpeg" style="width: 400px;" />
<p class="caption">Photo from the Sacramento Bee article.</p>
</div>
<p>The Sacramento Bee published <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/transportation/article115956748.html">an article</a> today showing off the city's work in
making Freeport Boulevard safer for pedestrians and bicyclists. This makeover
for the road was spurred by a locally <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pD8nujd2Ow">viral video</a> created by a McClatchy
high school student years ago showing how dangerous it was for her to get to
school by bicycle. Unfortunately, the primary photo they used for the article
shows a scenario that does not look that safe by most bicyclist and pedestrian
standards.</p>
<p>Note that there is a bicyclist in an extremely narrow bicycle lane (not
much wider than the handlebars), there is a bicyclist in the street, almost in
the oncoming automobile traffic lane, and there are pedestrians walking in the
automobile traffic lane seemingly not in any kind of crosswalk. The only
positive thing in this photo is that there is a bicycle lane, as opposed to
none. Being that the city spent $2.3M dollars to overhaul this road, it seems
like the money was ill-spent if this is all we get.</p>
<p>My buddy, Ted Beuhler, was in town so we decided to go check out Freeport with
our tape measure in hand and see whether or not the $2.3M actually did make the
road safer for bicyclists and pedestrians. We collected a number of photos with
road lane width measurements along Freeport. The tape measure has alternating
green and yellow blocks to indicate feet and the 10 foot blocks are designated
in red. All of the photos are in a <a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/photos/nntCDjSs4Kvvwyku9">public photo album</a> and have comments that
explain the photos.</p>
<p>The key new features of Freeport are that some portions of the road had a road
diet, i.e. four auto travel lanes changed into two auto travel lanes, one auto
center turn lane, and bicycle lanes on each side. Secondly, the intersections
of Sutterville &amp; Freeport and 21st &amp; Freeport now have portions of the bicycle
lanes painted green to create a very visible space for bicyclists to traverse
automobile merge lanes.</p>
<p>These changes are an improvement to what was there but I think that with a
little bit of critical thought and creativity the road could have been made
much safer for bicyclists and pedestrians at a number of locations with little
to no change in cost. The following details some of our findings and opinions:</p>
<div class="section" id="gutter-pans-are-not-bicycle-lanes">
<h2>Gutter pans are not bicycle lanes</h2>
<p>Sacramento has a fair amount of bicycle lanes compared to similar cities around
the country, but the city seems to insist on forcing bicyclists to ride in the
gutter. Most bicycle lanes in Sacramento are around a 5 foot width <em>if you
include the gutter</em>. The problem with this is that a bicyclist has to ride
either in the gutter or on the asphalt. The 1/4&quot; to 1&quot; lip between the two
surfaces is enough to throw you off the bicycle, so it is impossible to use the
full lane. You either have to have your elbow hanging in the auto lane or ride
in the 1 to 2 foot wide gutter while dodging debris and drainage grates.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Image of showing how much of the bike path is the gutter" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IDysWfEONuRhT_QFuwVQItgqSp-6mcJQ9fVMoYi5LYEnvzEg3hz0wwhsazQZjyS7Lu4MrisVg_Mh7VN3cRCQkWKpqXNGKElxy7dztSWZ7K-ROEMaiC_MC5Ljj5z9XADskechEoajjp8BzK3V4DJcP8PJomlCcfSCYg5NAVOxc5RTEWkzMiarmM9vU08QSzewaTQ1NLsNobCCLz4HNFizJqdk0ITSenAh_hivk1d9_x9nQ2pm5cE0aItrn1hI8Oaz9z6hKvb40M9SD05rwiyNV44ECCUZeKQEnIMWoI2n-UHKVsPpocnGqVfbvVB-FPWggM58wsb5tTqlyKmEIDUhM8KMIU8p6aARcLGH3bMkAhPre6VnrTXTds_oRJWcZP-lD9-Aj4sQd8uolaq2H2BOUH58DO5PDUif2ErFHZ-Z9vtwiQe9xWVCKvQfwWNDI9pLNsAq18eBttxpPHABcO71sXS_vk-ty1bol_4vq3JnwyutmHnhYmkuOhDkykUTOaLR25vFaPIL6EtFlDrVwBhsk9EEA50T2mklF-MmViysirITMwZ7nJZa8k9ZqvlZk144RLZIiwh41R0fuevqoudZ1zbme59vjeZ1CXuYSkqS8xFLoCzZsA=w1560-h878-no" style="width: 600px;" />
<p class="caption">This photo taken right in front of McClatchy High School shows and elderly
gentleman who decides to ride in the 2 foot wide gutter pan to be further
from the cars. There is no option to ride in the middle of the 5 foot
&quot;bicycle lane&quot;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="all-auto-lanes-should-be-10-foot-wide-and-no-more">
<h2>All auto lanes should be 10 foot wide and no more</h2>
<p>We measured auto lane widths on Freeport that ranged from 10.5 to 13 feet wide.
The minimum auto lane width required by the <a class="reference external" href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part6/part6h.htm">MUTCD</a> is 10 ft. Narrow auto lanes
reduce automobile speeds and free up more space for bicycle lanes that are
actually safe (particularly buffered lanes).</p>
<p>For example, where 21st intersects the light rail lines there are three auto
lanes. The northbound lanes are 13 ft and 11 ft. The bicycle lane is about 2.5
feet of asphalt and just under two feet of gutter pan. Additionally, the
southbound lane has a 3 to 4 foot section of unused lane now that the
bicyclists are directed to follow the green markings into the pedestrian
island. That is close to 8 feet of additional space that could be used to
create a buffered bicycle lane on the northbound side.</p>

<p class="caption">This photo shows the large 13 foot and 11 foot wide northbound automobile
lanes and the tiny 2.5 foot bicycle lane (which gets even narrower as it
approaches the train tracks).</p>
</div>
<p>Additionally, the southbound Freeport bicycle lanes are significantly less wide
than the northbound side. Why make it less safe for southbound bicyclists?</p>
<p>If we want pedestrian and bicyclist friendly streets, we need narrow streets.
Narrow streets have been <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pps.org/reference/livememtraffic/">shown to</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>lower the automobile speeds</li>
<li>ease pedestrian crossing</li>
<li>increase space for pedestrians and bicyclists</li>
</ul>
<p>The $2.3M resurfacing and re-striping of Freeport should have ensured narrow
automobile lanes, yet we've shown it didn't in most sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-modal-traffic-areas-should-be-more-convenient-for-pedestrians-and-bicyclists">
<h2>Multi-modal traffic areas should be more convenient for pedestrians and bicyclists</h2>
<p>Our cities are designed around making the automobile transportation mode as
convenient as possible. This is at the expense of walking and bicycling. The
new design of the intersection of 21st and Freeport makes it less convenient for
the bicyclists. They are now forced to ride onto the traffic island, press the
pedestrian walk signal (which isn't within an arm's length of the green
lane), and wait for the pedestrian cycle. This is likely safer for bicyclists
as the merging Freeport traffic has to face them at a 90 degree angle at a stop
light, but I doubt that bicyclists are going to do that, especially when there
is a perceived more convenient route to the left of the pedestrian island. The
real fix for that intersection would involve removing the ability for
southbound Freeport traffic to merge at speed onto 21st.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="big-green-bicycle-lanes-are-awesome">
<h2>Big green bicycle lanes are awesome!</h2>
<p>The city did create a 6 ft wide green bicycle lane on the southbound side of
Freeport just past the Sutterville intersection. This is a great move, but we
need more of these!</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Note that this short span of green bicycle lane is 6 feet wide, which is
pretty nice, especially since most cars are travelling at 40+ mph through
this intersection and cars are merging at 25-30 mph across the green lane.
This lanes still needs a buffer since auto speeds are so high (or we need to
slow down the vehicles). This kind of lane width should be used on the
entire length of Freeport on both north- and south-bound lanes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bicycle-lanes-are-travel-lanes">
<h2>Bicycle lanes are travel lanes!</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many city dwellers do not recognize that the bicycle lane is a
travel lane just as much as the auto lanes are. This means that they often park
in the lanes, put yard waste in the lanes (piles and/or bins), and turn into
the lanes without looking for bicyclists. On this single Sunday morning ride we
came across two vehicles parked in the southbound bicycle lanes:</p>
<div class="figure">

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It's great that Sacramento did something about Freeport Boulevard. It is
certainly better than it was. But if we are going to spend $2.3M dollars to
make it safe for pedestrians and bicyclists, why not make it as safe as you can
with that amount of money? If the engineers and planners focused on the safety
of bicyclists and pedestrians we'd have a very different Freeport Boulevard.
Careful thought on lane striping goes a long ways and if we really want to
be progressive we could implement some of the more modern infrastructure to
make these travel modes safer. This will reduce traffic speeds significantly
and help us create a walkable city. Just today, Long Beach has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.presstelegram.com/sports/20161117/little-green-things-spotted-on-studebaker">showed us up</a>
with beautiful buffered bicycle lanes. Sacramento could lead the state in
bicycle and pedestrian safety, but we don't. We are in the position to heavily
influence all of the state leaders that have to come here for government work.
It's too bad that we aren't stepping up to the plate to do that.</p>
