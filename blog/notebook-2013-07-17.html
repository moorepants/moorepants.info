<h2>Matlab Purchasing Options</h2>
<p>The following is a copy of the email I sent to my PI and the lab about
purchasing Matlab licenses:</p>
<p>I spoke with our Mathworks rep yesterday about purchasing Matlab licenses for
the lab and the ability to use Amazon AWS with Matlab for parallel computing
needs.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-matlab">
<h3>Basic Matlab</h3>
<p>We have two licensing options from Mathworks:</p>
<div class="section" id="academic-license">
<h4>Academic License</h4>
<p>Matlab plus all desired tool boxes are purchased for each computer we need it
for. This allows you to install the software on a machine for perpetual use,
but only on one machine. This is the ideal situation as but there is another
potentially cheaper option below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="concurrent-license">
<h4>Concurrent License</h4>
<p>The concurrent license scheme allows you to install software on a personal
server that allows people to checkout a license to Matlab. So Matlab is
installed on as many machines as you want, but you can't use it unless you are
connected to the server and a license is available. If you want to use Matlab
while you are away from the lab you would need to have a VPN type of IP routing
so that you can checkout a license when you are not in the lab. Going this
route could potentially allow you to purchase fewer copies of Matlab and fewer
copies of toolboxes because everyone isn't actually using all of these at the
same time as each other. This will require us to run and manage a local server
and probably setup this VPN thing.</p>
<p>Cost of core Matlab (no toolboxes):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1 license: $500</li>
<li>5-9 license: $300 each</li>
<li>10-?: $220 each</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost of toolboxes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1 general toolbox: $200</li>
<li>2-4 general toolboxes: $158 each</li>
<li>5-? general toolboxes: $105 each</li>
<li>Simulink 5-?: $150</li>
</ul>
<p>This includes 1 year of tech support and 1 year of upgrades (Matlab releases
twice a year).</p>
<p>Additional years of tech support and upgrades cost 20% of total license cost
(including toolbox costs) per year per license.</p>
<p>There is also a Student Version of Matlab that students can purchase for $99
for their personal machines. These technically can't be installed on University
owned computers. But our grad students can run this on their own machines if
they want.</p>
<p>The wish list of toolboxes we may use:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Optimization Toolbox</li>
<li>Global Optimization Toolbox</li>
<li>Control System Toolbox</li>
<li>System Identification Toolbox</li>
<li>Signal Processing Toolbox</li>
<li>Data Acquisition Toolbox</li>
<li>SimMechanics</li>
<li>Simulink</li>
<li>Parallel Computing Toolbox</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if you have any other favorites!</p>
<p>We can probably get away without buying all these depending on what we use. It
sounds like Sandy and Obinna only use simulink and the sys id toolboxes.</p>
<p>Ok, drum roll ....</p>
<p>If we assume we need 5 licenses available for simultaneous use and we get all
the tool boxes then the expensive cost (academic licenses) is something like:</p>
<p>5*$300 + 5*8*$105 + 5*$150 = <em>$6450</em></p>
<p>plus a <em>$1290</em> per year tech support/upgrade fee</p>
<p>If we got the cheaper route and get 5 licenses in the concurrent scheme,
purchase 2 of each toolbox, and buy a cheap low power server then we would
spend something like:</p>
<p>5*$300 + 2*8*$105 + 2*$150 = <em>$3480</em></p>
<p>plus a <em>$696</em> per year tech support/upgrade fee</p>
<p>If we go really cheap and I give you all a 2-3 workshop on Octave, Scilab, GSL,
and/or SciPy, etc then we can get &quot;most&quot; of this for:</p>
<p>$0</p>
<p>:)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parallel-computing">
<h3>Parallel Computing</h3>
<p>Matlab has a parallel toolbox that helps you parallelize your code from up to
12 cores per license. It offer's some basic function for writing parallel code
and you have access to many functions that we may normally use that have being
parallelized by Mathworks engineers. If you want to send jobs from this tool
box to higher core systems or clusters, then you need to buy the Distributed
Computing Server from Matlab. Dawei, in Dr. Simon's lab, somehow uses 2
licenses to run on 24 cores with simultaneous Matlab instances which is some
sort of hack, but can save you lots of money. The Distributed Computing server
also has facilities to send jobs to Amazon Web Services Ec2 instances for
multicore runs (this is relatively new).</p>
<p>The Distrubuted Computer Server has some steep costs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>up to 16 cores is $1650</li>
<li>up to 32 cores is $2950</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus if you want to use AWS instead of us buying and maintaining our own
hardware you pay these fees:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Matlab usage fee: $0.16 per core per hour</li>
<li>AWS Ec2 $0.06 to $4.60 per hour depending on size of machine/cluster (they
have up to 32 core machines and I think you can cluster instances too, maybe
up to 8).</li>
</ul>
<p>So for 1 32 core machine on AWS with Matlab for an hour computation you may
spend $5-$10. And for a AWS cluster of 32 core machines you may spend $40-$50
per hour.</p>
<p>My humble opinion on this is that if we really have some massive problems that
we want to run on clusters and/or high core machines that we rewrite our Matlab
code in other languages and deploy our problems to the cloud and we don't have
to pay Matlab's overhead. The open source world has this problem figured out
better than Matlab from what I can tell so far and there is little incentive to
pay Matlab's fees for this kind of stuff.</p>

<div class="section" id="making-purchases-at-csu">
<h2>Making Purchases at CSU</h2>
<p>I spoke with Patsy, our secretary, about how to actually purchase stuff we want
for the lab. For general lab equipment and such the process is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make sure the vendor can accept a purchase order</li>
<li>Go to online vendor's website</li>
<li>Select the items you want and put them in your shopping cart</li>
<li>Before you press &quot;Buy&quot;, print out the itemize cost sheet</li>
<li>Take this printout to the ME office</li>
<li>Patsy's fills out a form and sends it to the PI and the Chair for approval</li>
<li>Then this goes to the Dean's office for approval</li>
<li>Then it comes back to our office</li>
<li>Then I go back on the website to my hopefully saved shopping cart and finish the order</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still not sure how this works and if the vendor's online websites will take
a purchase order number instead of a credit card. This process seems like a
nightmare and no fun to do. Why are University's such in the stone age about
purchasing. Why can't I just have a debit card that is tied to our grant. I can
order stuff at my leisure and the power-at-be can approve things as I buy them
to finalize the deal. I don't even want to think about the number of hours I've
wasted with this kind of stuff in the past. The other option would be to by
anything less than $1500 or so with my personal debit/credit card and just turn
in a reimbursement form. Which often seems so much easier than a PO. Patsy also
wasn't sure how we can pay for online services that may or may not have a
variable monthly bill (like AWS, Dropbox, etc). She's looking into that for me.</p>

<div class="section" id="matlab-and-the-structural-model-work">
<h2>Matlab and the Structural Model Work</h2>
<p>I had some issues installing Matlab as I lost my original disk. I'll have to
figure something out soon to run my structural model system id. Postponed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-web-site">
<h2>Lab Web Site</h2>
<p>I thought I wouldn't ever deploy a Plone site again and would probably lean
towards static site generators, Django, Flask, etc, but I feel pretty
confident that this is a good solution for the Human Motion &amp; Control's lab
website. Plone offers an full featured solution to do the things we want to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Have public facing website</li>
<li>Have a collaborative work space for sharing our work both publically and
privately within out group</li>
<li>Share our publications, data, source code</li>
<li>Have a lab member web page for each student</li>
<li>Have a lab blog</li>
</ul>
<p>I purchased the better of the Plone books a year or so back
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/professional-plone-4-development/book">http://www.packtpub.com/professional-plone-4-development/book</a> and will go
through several of the Chapters so I can setup a proper dev environment for a
plone site and build our own theme with diazo.</p>
<p>User of the site</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The public</li>
<li>Grad students in the lab</li>
<li>The PI</li>
<li>Post docs and other lab members</li>
</ul>
<p>The PI, students, and other lab members should be able to edit the website content.
Content should default to private when published.</p>
<p>Sandy, one of Ton's grad students, made a sweet prototype of the website design:</p>

<div class="section" id="data-backup">
<h2>Data backup</h2>
<p>We are trying to think of a nice centralized way to backup our experimental
data. We have two computers that are offline and networked together that run
our data collection software (D-Flow and Cortex). They generate flat text files
for each experiment. But because they are offline for no-virus reasons, we need
a way to get the data from there to a backup destination and to our personal
computers for data analysis. I thought that we may be able to utilize cloud
data backup. Here's the email I sent out with a workflow idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this could be a solution for our data backup:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/business">https://www.dropbox.com/business</a></p>
<p>But it does seem pricey. Basically about 100 bucks per user per year.</p>
<p>I chatted with a sales rep and it has many cool features that we can use.</p>
<p>I imagine this work flow:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>take data on the offline mocap computer</li>
<li>plug in flash drive to mocap computer and run a simple program that
synchronizes the flash drive to a folder(s) in the d-flow/mocap computer</li>
<li>take the flash drive to a server we have connected to the net</li>
<li>run a similar script that synchronizes the flash drive to the drop box
folder on that machine</li>
<li>then drop box automatically does its synchronization to put our data in
the cloud</li>
<li>at this point there are four copies of the data: one on mocap computer,
one on flash drive, one on server, and one in the cloud (and the dropbox data
is versioned)</li>
<li>Now you go to your computer and select which folders you want to have
synchronized to your machine on dropbox so you can access the data you need</li>
</ol>
<p>So all data will be available to anyone with the our account (or we can even
make files public in dropbox for easy wider sharing).</p>
<p>But I also realized we could skip the drop box thing and do the traditional
method and just have this server so that we can ssh/ftp into it from anywhere
to get a copy of data. We'd lose automatic versioning and easy dropbox
interface, but it should effectively do the same thing.</p>
<p>I was also trying to imagine this workflow where we don't have the server
mentioned in step 3 and simply bring the flash drive back to your personal
computer. But we don't want to force our personal computers to have a full copy
of all the data, we only want the data we want to use on our personal
computers.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could also use our Amazon AWS server and an S3 bucket to run our own server
backup. And the S3 pricing is much more favorable. Even with the 30% academic
price reduction, drop box is super expensive.</p>
