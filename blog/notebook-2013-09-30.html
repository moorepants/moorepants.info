<h2>BMD2013</h2>
<p>I basically worked non-stop this week and last to get my two papers done for
BMD2013. Now I have a headache, but I think things turned out pretty good. The
papers and source are available here: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moorepants/BMD2013">https://github.com/moorepants/BMD2013</a>. It
is pretty close to having full computational reproducibility.</p>
<p>In the Whipple ID paper I realized I was computing the VAF is a silly way in my
dissertation. So I got all the code running again and redid those calcs. Of
course the results came out a bit different and I'm still not sure how to
interpret it all. I also can't figure out why dtk.process.fit_goodness() gives
different answers than my new dtk.process.coefficient_of_determination()
function. I wrote some extensive tests that pass, but there is still some bug
somewhere.</p>
<p>I've also been trying to upload my dissertation data onto figshare for easier
dissemination and citing. But Figshare's UI is so damn confusing and it also
has size limits which are a major limitation. Here is what I wrote to the help
desk there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have some data sets from some experimental studies that I'd like to upload
to figshare for public sharing but I'm having trouble uploading it an
efficient and organized way.</p>
<p>Here are basic descriptions of the datasets:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>762 compressed data files organized in subdirectories totaling 830 mb</li>
<li>1 compressed HDF5 file totaling ~ 300 mb</li>
<li>525 mp4 video files of experiments totaling 2.5 Gb</li>
<li>1,202 data and text files in a particular subdirectory structure totaling 120 mb</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like to be able to upload these five sets as single compressed tar balls so
that a user simply has to download the tar ball, uncompress it, and run the
software that works with the data. Right now, I can't upload the files that are
larger than 250 mb due to your limit. I've also tried uploading the files
individually but the interface makes this unwieldy and it seems impossible to
keep the directory structures I want. I could break up all of the datasets into
multiple tar balls (except the HDF5 file) and upload them in that fashion but
it is not preferable. Do you have recommendations on how to share this data
with your service?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The response I got was that Figshare doesn't allow big files and they will have
a subscription that you can pay for to remove the file size limits. That's lame
but there is little reason to think any web service is gonna let you upload a
ton GB's of data and they front the cost of distributing that data. It'd be
cool if Universities fronted the cost by paying Figshare. Then all researchers
at that Uni could upload there stuff. Many universities roll their own
institutional repositories, but Figshare could potentially be a better option
than that.</p>
<p>My time tracker says I've spent 48 hours on the Whipple ID paper, 20.2 hours on
the steer torque paper, and a total of 73 hours for BMD related things since
the beginning of July. I need to focus on walking work now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-assessment">
<h2>Time Assessment</h2>
<p>Since I've been here this is how I've spent my time:</p>
<p>Since July 8th I've worked 504.4 hours. There have been 60 weekdays and 1
holiday = 59 workdays. So that's averaging 8.55 hours a day of actual work time
(this number doesn't count internet surfing, breaks, general chit chatting, or
anything that isn't actually doing work. I only log real work time.). I even
took a week off in July (but worked about 17 hours that week.) and still
averaged a lot of hours a week.</p>
<p>The approximate break down of the type of work I've done is: 290 hours have
been doing stuff related to the HMC lab. 35 has been for CSU related stuff. And
175 hours has been doing my research interests. So the percentage is:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">HMC 58%</div>
<div class="line">CSU 7%</div>
<div class="line">Personal Research 35%</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>But I don't feel like I've gotten hardly anything done in the HMC side with
respect to the research project. I've spent 85 hours of the 290 on actually
doing the walking system id. The rest has been website admin, purchasing,
training, lab meetings, mentoring, and my lab notebook. So I've only spent 16%
of my &quot;work&quot; time doing the research project Ton has tasked me with. Which is
why I've made more progress on my research stuff than the walking stuff. I'm
not sure if this counts as being productive for my job...</p>
<p>But I think this will change now. I've gotten over the large portion of the BMD
conference hump. GSoC is over. I've gotten over the being new at CSU hump. We
have more help in the lab for random things. I'm going to contract out the web
work that still remains. So from now on, I think I'll be significantly more
productive with the walking research projects. But I am going to take on a
senior design group, which will probably take a similar amount of time as GSoC.
I'd also really like to teach a class too. It's funny how time gets so much
more valuable as you get older.</p>
