    <div class="content">
      <p>In 2009, Mont Hubbard, Ronald A. Hess, Dale L. Peterson, and I were awarded
$300K for a two year <a class="reference external" href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1631133">grant</a> from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to study
how people are able to balance on bicycles. We completed the work in September
2012 after an additional one year no-cost extension. This resulted in numerous
research products that have been well cited since the completion of the work.</p>
<p>In 2011, US Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) released a report entitled &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation:_Under_the_Microscope">The National
Science Foundation: Under the Microscope</a>&quot; with the intention to expose
wasteful spending of US tax dollars by the NSF. The grant we were awarded was
listed as one of the examples of &quot;silly research&quot;. This received a fair amount
of media attention and we were interviewed for a number of publications to
comment on this report, e.g. in <a class="reference external" href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/us-senator-calls-robot-projects-wasteful">IEEE Spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>Then again in 2014, US Assemblyman Lamar Smith (R-TX), the chair of the House's
Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/10/battle-between-nsf-and-house-science-committee-escalates-how-did-it-get-bad">launched an investigation</a> into
NSF's wasteful spending, also bringing our grant and work back into the
spotlight.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I have responded to various media inquiries but never
developed a statement in our own words that reflects our opinion on this
matter. Now 4.5 years later, this past week a journalist contacted us with this
question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Professor Hubbard,</p>
<p>I'm a reporter with &lt;redacted&gt; writing on the implications of the Scientific
Research in the National Interest Act (HR 3293). I'm highlighting interesting
research that lawmakers decried as a misuse of federal funds and came upon
your NSF-funded research about how people ride bikes. I was wondering if you
knew of any instances of your findings from that study being used in a
meaningful way, perhaps by cities to decongest roads and increase bike
ridership or something along those lines. I'd love to include it in my piece.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>&lt;redacted&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This request prompted us to formulate some responses. In particular, I finally
found a moment to put some thoughts to paper. The letter below is my and Mont's
response to this journalist that we believe summarizes our opinion on the
continued attacks by some Congress members on the NSF:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;redacted&gt;,</p>
<p>Thank you for your inquiry. Yes, our NSF funded research has been targeted in
the past by some  members of Congress that consider it to have been a waste
of money. You asked if we &quot;knew of any instances of [our] findings from that
study being used in a meaningful way, perhaps by cities to decongest roads
and increase bike ridership&quot;. This question suggests that you may have the
same misunderstanding about our research as some members of Congress do.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of our research was to develop experimentally validated
mathematical models that accurately predict the interaction between, and
motion of, a human and the vehicle they are controlling. We chose the bicycle
because it is one of the more dynamically complex vehicles humans learn to
control and because it is a familiar, inexpensive, and tractable experimental
platform (e.g. it is orders of magnitude cheaper than buying a F-22 Raptor
and performing experiments with it, yet you get similarly meaningful
results).</p>
<p>In the four and a half years since our NSF grant ended, our research has
influenced the robotics, vehicle dynamics, manual control, vehicle safety,
sports engineering, biomechanics, and system identification research
communities, which can be seen by the more than one hundred of citations to
our research products. Additionally, the results of our NSF funded work have
played roles in the progress of a number of companies, some of which have
employed the 10+ graduate and undergraduate students that were involved the
NSF funded research. We also speculate that a long-term, broader impact of
our work may specifically affect future bicycle, scooter, and motorcycle
designs that could contribute to our country's transportation needs.</p>
<p>But, as with many of the congressionally targeted studies, there seems to be
a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of the questioned research. NSF
requires applicants to write a broader impact statement and this ends up as
fully a third of the publicly visible grant abstract, whereas it is often
only a very small component of the work and deliverables specified in the
full proposal. This abstract is what a congressional aide may typically read.
We do believe that our research will eventually play a role in the broader
impacts we wrote, but it is much too soon to know for certain and further
work must be done to ensure the impact. Also, as with any research, we may be
wrong and our broader impacts may not come to fruition. It would not be
called research if that risk were not present.</p>
<p>One story that needs to be written is about the NSF's inability to properly
communicate science to the public and Congress and the corresponding
misunderstanding of science that the public and Congress seem to have. The
scientific process is a remarkable one that thrives on vehemently eliminating
untruth. Because there are only a few scientists in Congress, little to no
experience with this process is present. This lack of experience contributes
to the lack of trust in the funding, results, and reliability of science. NSF
could obviously be doing a better job convincing Congress of its merit.</p>
<p>Another story could include the fact that the broader impacts section of NSF
grants is often a meaningless statement to fulfill a checkbox that is rarely
actually delivered. For example, many robotics grants cite that their robots
will help in search and rescue missions in natural disasters, just to pander
to the popular sentiment that this is a good use of research funds. Yet few
robots are developed for that specific purpose. You could just count the
number of papers and grants that claim this to find out if the robot ended up
in any actual applied search and rescue missions.</p>
<p>Obtaining a NSF grant is a highly competitive process. Only about 20% of
proposed grants are awarded. Once the NSF establishes its research
directions, the competitive review process is one of the most thorough to be
found, in which national experts are gathered to critically screen the
submitted proposals over several  days. We agree that there may be some small
percentage of past NSF proposals that this careful process overlooked that
might have eventually benefited society more than the ones chosen. But we
feel this percentage is so small that it does not provide any evidence that
NSF's system is poor or broken. We have high confidence that virtually all
funded NSF research grants are worthy of being funded.</p>
<p>Funding scientific research is not like going to Walmart to buy a &quot;whatzit&quot;.
Our present unfunded research has continued along the lines originally begun
in our NSF grant. Specifically, we are now researching the process of optimal
design of bicycles (which actually is something of a whatzit). This present
research was enabled by the prior NSF grant and is an entirely meaningful
contribution resulting from the NSF's support.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that your article will highlight the disconnect between the
House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the scientists and
engineers that NSF funds. Just producing a tit for tat exchange on whether
their targeted funded grants actually produced something is missing the most
important point.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
