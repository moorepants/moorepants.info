    <div class="content">
      <p>Last week I taught an introduction to version control with Git to the UCD
computer science capstone design course. There were about 100 students and I
took them through the <a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> Git lesson in just over 1.5 hours.
From the feedback, I think it went really well. But there were some interesting
tidbits that I learned teaching this to undergraduates instead of the typical
group of graduate students.</p>
<p>We used the <a class="reference external" href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">SWC Git novice lesson</a>. I only went through sections 1 through 9
as sections 10-12 weren't really relevant to the students in the class and
there wasn't enough time. The class was setup just as normal; I gave the
installation instructions out one week in advance. Surprisingly, there wasn't a
single installation issue at the beginning of class! I had two TA helpers
(maybe three) and at least on undergraduate helper who reviewed the materials
and were given some prompts on how to use the Etherpad, the sticky notes, and
their roles. I live coded through the lesson with the students following along.
I closed with collecting feedback and answering final questions. The following
lists some of the things that I noted during and after the class:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It was hard to get any kind of verbal reaction from the students or get them
to volunteer to speak. I generally sensed an emotionless crowd, but the
feedback I collected at the end told otherwise. Many claimed the lesson was
good or great. I think most were shy and this style of teaching isn't
something they are used to.</li>
<li>The Etherpad wasn't used well, in fact, the chat room became a place for bad
jokes and goofing off. So much so that the professor asked some students to
see her after class (they didn't have enough foresight to create a false
name). We should have monitored this and encouraged proper use. After reading
the feedback, they would have definitely appreciated having the commands I
was typing in that document. I'll need to make sure the helpers work at this
and even start the note taking to initiate good behavior there.</li>
<li>It was hard to get them to use the sticky notes. This may have been partly
because I didn't explain them well. So it wasn't until the last sections when
more people needed help that I was able to get visual feedback with them. And
still only 60% or so seemed to use the notes at all as a signal.</li>
<li>Many of the students had used Git before, but after reading the feedback I
collected at the end, I think the novice lesson was the right choice. There
were more &quot;too fast&quot; statements than &quot;too slow&quot;.</li>
<li>Many would like to have seen some information on branching and more examples
on merging and conflicts. The one merge we did didn't seem to provide enough
to really get it. And we didn't talk about branching at all.</li>
<li>I covered the material in 1.5 hours, which is faster than a normal SWC
workshop (~2.5 hrs). As I said above, there were a fair number of &quot;too fast'
complaints, but I think if they had taken notes in the Etherpad or noticed
the cheatsheet I had linked in the Etherpad I would have had fewer. I'll need
to point to the cheatsheet explicitly next time.</li>
<li>Not many students were familiar with the UNIX command line, so I gave a few
sentence explanation of commands, sub-commands, flags, and arguments. I think
since they've done a fair amount of programming that this was easy to pick
up. This isn't always the case with non-cs students.</li>
<li>Github happened to go down an hour before I taught this and didn't come back
online to just at the end of class. This at least gave me a chance to talk
about why it is really bad to have a SaaS that so many people use go down
like this. I wish I had an estimate of the money that the downtime cost all
the users of Gitub. I improvised and used Bitbucket instead. That went pretty
well except for one hiccup, I didn't know how to properly use the Bitbucket
https URL in the partner portion of the lesson. You have to specify it as
<tt class="docutils literal">git clone
<span class="pre">https://yourusername&#64;bitbucket.com/partnerusername/reponame.git</span></tt>. Some
students helped me figure that the username before the <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;</tt> needs to be your
own username for proper authentication.</li>
<li>It wasn't until we got to using Bitbucket that I started getting more
questions from the students and the helpers had to scramble around the room
to help people out. This let the helpers be a little complacent for the first
hour or so and they suddenly had to do a bunch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I think the lesson was the right scope and level for the class even
though most had some experience with Git in some fashion. Although, we could
think about breaking the section into two: novice and intermediate and teach
two simultaneous lessons in two rooms.</p>
<p>The student feedback is below:</p>
