For the past several months I have been involved with some 200 transit riders
in an attempt to save the 30+ year old UC Davis Intercampus Shuttle from the
ill-decided changes by UC Davis (my employer), The City of Sacramento (where I
live), Sacramento Regional Transit, and Yolo County Transit District. We have
salvaged some of the service by investing hundreds of hours in advocacy work
that we rely on by advocating to the University and the Councial members
involved in the two transit agencies, but there is still much to do to bring
back what has been unfairly made worse for the riders.

This experience exposed to me how poorly Universities, Cities, and public
agencies make decisions that affect their constituents and also how poorly they
handle being called out on doing so. The story behind the fate of the UCD
Intercampus Shuttle is suprisingly tied up in intertwined planned schemes where
the actors did and didn't know what was going on. Quite a few fishy things were
exposed to me and the purpose of this peice is to write them all down together,
at length, so that some light can be shed on the behind-the-scenes potentially
dubious workings of the parties involved.  When each of the items are take
individually it is easy to write them off, but when taken together maybe they
shouldn't be written off.

I'll start by listing the main points and below they will be backed up with
evidence and commentary:

- A new public transit line conceived, designed, and almost completely finalized that
  did not serve the needs of the primary target riders
- SACOG and Electrify America award millions based on proposals with little to
  no evidence.
- UCD and Sacramento sends speakers to public hearings to advocate against
  their constituents.
- Electrify America, LLC is company, funding granter, and political advocate
  all in one.
- Planning at the transit agencies is poor and not data driven.
- UCD focused on quelling the publicity of the complaints instead of addressing
  the issues.
- UCD neglected its students and employees
- SacRT do the bidding of the boards not the public
- This was not part of Sacramento's Electric Vehicle strategy.
- Focus on Electric vehicles misses the point.
- Lost focus on low income communities
- Bought the wrong buses
- EA funds had to be spent by 2020
- UCD is not saving money
- No accountability on what is proposed
- Electrify America's goal is to position Volkswagen favorably for electric cars
  not reduce emissions

Volkswagen's Emisions Scandal Settlement and Sacramento, the new "Green City"
=============================================================================

.. topic:: TLDR;
   :class: alert alert-info

   1. Electrify America agreed to use $44M of the $800M California settlement funds to
      introduce public electric car chargers, a ZEV car‐sharing program, a ZEV
      delivery fleet, and a ZEV taxi fleet provider to Sacramento. This
      investment plan was approved by the California Air Resources Board.
      Instead, $11M was used to purchase unapproved (by CARB) electric buses
      for SacRT and YCTD and the remainder was used to introduce chargers and
      ZEV car-sharing. No delivery fleets or taxi fleets were implemented. Many
      of these items were not completed by the January 1, 2020 deadline.
   2. Sacramento pledged to use the $44M to focus almost exclusively on
      disadvantaged Sacramento residents, in particular the homeless, yet the
      reality is that those residents were a mere afterthought in the
      executution of the programs and virtually none of the investments will
      help them.

As a part of the `Volkswagen Emissions Scandal Settlement`_ to the United
States of America, Volkswagen has to pay $2 billion for "clean-emissions
infrastructure" in the country. In order to administer the $2B from 2016 to
2026, Volkswagen setup a company, `Electrify America`_ LLC. Electrify America's
primary purpose is to fund and manage a non-proprietary network of electric
vehicle charging stations around the country.

.. _Volkswagen Emissions Scandal Settlement: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal#Settlement
.. _Electrify America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America

Electrify America LLC developed investment plans for different geographic
locations. For California, they are to spend $800 million (of the $2B) over 10
years in four consecutive $200 million 30-month cycles. As part of the first
cycle of the California investment plan, they decided to fund a "Green City"
that will showcase electric vehicle technologies. Electrify America accepted
proposals from various California cities for $44M to do so in early 2017.

Sacramento submitted a "Green City" proposal [#]_ in January of 2017 that was
ultimately awarded. Darrell Steinberg opens the proposal with a letter that
spends a fair amount of time talking about how he's hired Mike McKeever
(retired SACOG CEO of 14 years [#]_) as his Chief of Staff and that McKeever would be in
charge of the Green City program, would it be awarded. If there is a central
theme to this proposal, **it is most certainly how Sacramento will use the
money for electric vehicles to help the city's most disadvantaged people in the
city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods**, i.e. "Promise Zones". There is one
small mention of EV shuttle routes:

   Another priority for Green City programs will be design of a system of
   dynamic ZEV shuttle routes that can support homeless individuals, expanding
   access and connecting some of Sacramento's most vulnerable to shelter and
   services.

.. [#] Green City Concept Proposal: Submission to Electrify America January 16, 2017 https://www.cityofsacramento.org/-/media/Corporate/Files/Public-Works/Electric-Vehicles/Sacramento-GreenCityProposal.pdf

.. [#] https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article121450212.html

As far as I know, there are no "dynamic ZEV shuttle routes" for the homeless
that have been proposed or created over the last year 30 months. This is
clearly both an example of not doing what one proposes and fluffing up a grant
proposal with utter bullshit. Personal electric vehicles are a rich man's toy
that justifies their excessive consumption of public resources. If you really
want to help the disadvantaged with $44M you could let poor people swap their
existing cars for EVs and charging station installations.

The proposal also discusses using electric vehicles to solve the "first
mile/last mile" issue of Sacramento's light rail and there is a brief mention
that SacRT had plans to pilot a battery powered bus.

   Regional Transit (RT) operates a bus fleet running on 100% compressed
   natural gas, with initial trials beginning as early as 1993. RT has plans
   underway to pilot the region's first battery-powered electric buses, and
   continues to implement new efforts to spur transit ridership.

No significant efforts to address the first mile/last mile connections to
Sacramento's current transit seem to be implemented.

One other item in the proposal that seems relevant to the Intercampus Shuttle
issue is their claim that:

  The City will coordinate an advisory committee with other key stakeholders,
  including the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies, nonprofits such as
  Valley Vision, state agencies, community groups, and other advisory members,
  such as members of the AB 32 Environmental Justice Advisory Committee.

I have yet to find evidence that this advisory committee exists. If it did,
then maybe the city would be appropriating this money in a just way.

The finalized investment plan from Electrify America LLC [#]_ released in March
of 2017 describes what the future Sacramento $44M Green City money should be
spent on says that it will be used for electric car-sharing, delivery fleets,
and taxi fleets:

   BUILDING A GREEN CITY FOR ZEV ACCESS (~$44 million)

   Electrify America has identified three potential Green City initiatives on
   which to focus: ZEV car‐sharing, ZEV delivery fleet, and ZEV taxi fleet
   provider. The first 30‐month investment cycle for Green City will
   concentrate approximately $44M of funding on developing the foundational
   infrastructure and planning for the launch of Green City initiatives
   (currently anticipated to be in Sacramento) as well as the launch of
   services.

   Foundational work for the first Green City initiatives is planned to begin
   in Q3 2017, including the installation of approximately 75 supporting
   chargers. Site development for the estimated 75 supporting chargers is
   planned to begin by Q1 2018, with development completed for all stations by
   end of Q4 2019. This infrastructure associated with Green City is expected
   to cost approximately $11 million.

Electrify America obviously had chosen Sacramento for this money before writing
the document, but only the proposed initiatives ZEV car share aligned with
Sacramento's proposal. There are no mentions of buses, shuttles, or public
transit in Electrify America's investment plans. Additionally, all stations are
to be completed in 2019, which is not the case.

TODO: Read supplement [#]_

.. [#] California ZEV Investment Plan: Cycle 1 March 18, 2017 https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/msprog/vw_info/vsi/vw-zevinvest/documents/vwinvestplan1_031317.pdf
.. [#]  (need to read) Supplement to investment plan: https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/msprog/vw_info/vsi/vw-zevinvest/documents/california_zev_investment_plan_supplement_062917.pdf


The California Air Resources Board wrote a Staff Analysis of Electrify
America's Investment plan [#]_ in July of 2017. The executive summary states:

   Appendix C outlines four areas of permissible investments: ZEV
   infrastructure (including the development and maintenance of ZEV charging
   stations), public awareness, increasing ZEV access, and the establishment of
   a "Green City" with emphasis on transportation electrification projects like
   car sharing, electric taxis, and zero-emission freight vehicles.

This analysis points out that the proposed car share in Sacramento is a way to
increasing ZEV access to disadvantaged community members and that the taxis and
delivery fleets could too. They had to force Electrify America to make changes
so that at least 35% of new charging stations are in disadvantaged communities
to meet California Law. They state that future cycles of investment should
include heavy duty vehicles (e.g. transit vehicles) but that is not included
here. Electrify America was also asked to provide transparency to the selection
of Sacramento but an odd summarized answer was given:

   With respect to the Green City selection, Electrify America provided
   information on commute flow patterns and identified connected centers of
   high transportation flows within the given metropolitan areas.

On August 2, 2017, Sacramento City Council directed Sacramento City staff went
to work with Electrify America LLC. Staff also had a directive to develop an
"Electric Vehicle Strategy" [#]_ for Sacramento. The "Electric Vehicle
Strategy" was passed by council December 12 2017 with a portion of it dedicated
to planning how the $44M from Electrify America would be spent before the 2020
deadline. The foci for the $44M was described as:

   Electrify America's initial investment in Sacramento will be focused on the
   following activities:

      - Construction and operation of a network of Level 2 chargers, DC fast
        chargers, and high-power charging, with a minimum of 75 chargers to be
        installed by mid-2019
      - Launch of a new EV car share program
      - Evaluation of opportunities for zero-emission delivery fleets and
        e-taxis
      - Expanding access to ZEV technologies for disadvantaged and low-income
        communities

.. [#] Electric Vehicle Strategy (passed by council December 12, 2017) http://www.cityofsacramento.org/-/media/Corporate/Files/Public-Works/Electric-Vehicles/EVStrategy_171212_FINAL_CityOfSacramento.pdf?la=en

None of these foci are directly related electrifying public or private mass
transit and eliminating an existing shuttle service is certainly not present.
It could be argued that replacing the Intercampus Shuttle with a public transit
route that uses electric buses could expand ZEV access to disadvantaged and
low-income communities, but a commuter bus line between the UCD Med Center and
UC Davis Main campus is not serving those communities other than peripherally.
It is clear in the prior proposals and investment strategies that "expanding
access to ZEV technologies" is "expanding access to ZEV charging infrastructure
and cars". The strategy reiterates the goals of the City's Green City proposal:

   The proposal outlines the City's priorities for investment, including
   enhancing mobility options for low-income residents in disadvantaged
   communities, strengthening first-mile/last-mile connections to transit,
   workforce development and training, and establishing Sacramento as a hub for
   research and development in zero-emission technologies.

   To this end, efforts to expand ZEVs will prioritize shared mobility
   opportunities, and ensure that ZEVs are working to fill the
   first-mile/last-mile gap to transit and improve the connectivity of areas
   underserved by transportation options.

The performance metrics in the strategy focus solely on increasing the
percentage and number of personal ZEVs and there are no targets related to
electrification of transit. There is a section on "Action" (i.e. things
Sacramento should do) Some "Actions" discuss EV buses but none of the Actions
related to EA's Green City mention anything about transit, electric or not.

   2.1.2 Support partner efforts to transition bus fleets to ZEV models.

   2.1.5 Partner with other agencies to identify and support grant
   opportunities for demonstration medium-and heavy-duty ZEV projects.

   5.2.2 Encourage RT and local school districts to accelerate the transition
   of bus fleets to ZEV models.

After this was presented at the December 12, 2017 City Council meeting, Darrell
Steinberg closed the discussion by praising the strategy and then from left
field declares that even though this idea isn't part of the strategy there
shall be electric shuttles running between UC Davis and Sacramento at a 15
minute frequency.

Steinberg's declaration was not included in the final strategy, yet $11 million
of the $44 million that Sacramento was awarded was earmarked behind closed
doors for the purchase of 12 electric buses from `Proterra Inc.`_ which is a
Daimler AG financed electric bus company run by Ryan Popple, ex-Telsa
employee.

The New Chancellor and the Mayor
================================

In June of 2017, Gary May, UC Davis's incoming Chancellor, takes Darrell
Steinberg to Atlanta Georgia to show him Atlanta's "Tech Square" [#]_. In late
July 2017, Electrify America officially announces the Green City award to
Sacramento. Gary May starts at UC Davis on August 1, 2017 and announces on his
first day that he is going to create a Sacramento Tech Center.

Missing the Emissions Point
===========================

.. topic:: TLDR;
   :class: alert alert-info

   The most effective way to reduce transportation related emissions is to
   reduce the number of single occupancy vehicles. Yet the decision makers do
   all they can to avoid this solution. Switching to all electric vehicles will
   not solve our emissions and climate issues.

- Decreasing single occupancy vehicles is single most effective way to reduce
  vehicle emissions
- Compare swapping all diesel public transit buses to EVs to getting X number
  of drivers to take transit

Politicians and transportation decision makers in Sacramento and California
seem to have a strong fetish with electric vehicles. It is their #1 proposed
solution to climate and emissions issues. Yes, if all petroleum powered cars
were switched to electric power, we'd have positive improvements in emissions
within areas in the state that are dense with motor vehicle traffic. But I
believe the true reason that the fetish is with electric vehicles is because
decision makers don't want to consider the real solution to climate change and
emissions due to the transportation sector. That solution is to **reduce the
number of (or elimate) low occupancy vehicles on our roads**.

Research shows that huge improvements in emissions, particulates, climate
warming, traffic congestion, traffic related injuries/deaths, outdated vehicle
waste, government spending, and people's happiness will occur if we make
serious reductions. But decision makers don't want to think about this because
they are car drivers and they can't possibly imagine giving up their own car,
so instead the fetish develops with the electric car, i.e. a way for them to
keep their car and feel like they are saving the environment. It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to show that focusing on reducing cars will vastly outpace
positive impacts than switching to electric vehicles [#]_.

Reducing traffic congestion
   Switching to electric vehicles causes **zero** improvement to traffic
   congestion.
Traffic related injuries and deaths
   Switching to electric vehicles causes **zero** improvement to traffic
   deaths.
Outdated vehicle waste
   Switching to electric vehicles will make vehicle waste problems worse
   because of the electric batteries.
Government spending
   Switching to electric vehicles will not reduce the money needed to fund and
   maintain infrastructure to support motor vehicles.

Emissions
---------

Tailpipe emissions are made up of numerous noxious components that harm our
environment and ourselves in a variety of ways. CO2 is one harmful component
that is linked to rising global temperatures. As an example on emissions
reductions, here are some numbers that provide estimate C02 emissions based on
California's electricity generation:

.. class:: table table-striped table-bordered

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Vehicle Type
     - Average grams of CO2 per passenger per mile
   * - Single occpuancy vehicle [?]
     - 410
   * - Diesel bus [within city]
     -
   * - CNG bus [within city]
     -
   * - Electric bus [within city]
     -
   * - Single occupancy vehicle [on freeway]
     -
   * - Diesel bus [on freeway]
     - 56
   * - CNG bus [on freeway]
     -
   * - EV bus [on Freeway]
     - 11

California has a mandate to switch all public transit vehicles to electric by
2036. Agencies, like SacRT, will have to meet this. To do this, requires huge
investments in resources. What if those resources were instead used to change
the mode choice of SOV drivers to transit?

To get the same reduction in CO2 emissions as switching all public transit
vehicles electric the state could instead **cause X number of SOV drivers to
switch to transit** that uses CNG vehicles or X number for diesel vehicles.

This relates to the Intercampus Shuttle issue because the decision makers could
not see beyond their fetish for electric buses. The proposed change to the
service would have degraded the service such that ridership would have very
likely declined [#]_. For example, moving a passenger from a single occupancy
vehicle to a diesel bus reduces per person total emissions **9 times more**
than switching a passenger from a diesel bus to an electric bus on this
particular route [#]_. Any changes or additions to transit between Davis and
Sacramento should wholly be focused on increasing ridership, i.e. causing SOV
passengers to choose the bus instead. Few to no riders will make that switch
solely based on a bus being electric versus diesel or CNG. Riders will make
that switch based on convenience, trip duration, frequency, stop locations,
safety, ride quality as primary motivators. Decision makers that do not
understand these research backed principles for increasing ridership should
simply not be making decisions about transit.

.. [#] We should likely do both things, but it still isn't clear that the
   massive production of batteries is going to be good for the environment
   either. So we may gain in emissions but lose in hazarddous waste increases.
   Fortunately, reducing cars makes gains on both.
.. [#] More on this is in the section about the SACOG grant proposal. There is
   is shown that the grant writers VMT caculations completely disregarded the
   number of riders that would quit riding the bus and switch back to SOVs.
.. [#] 8.9 = (410 gCO2/passenger/mile [SOV] - 11 gCO2/passenger/mile [EV Bus
   Freeway])/(56 gCO2/passenger/mile [Diesel Bus Freeway] - 11
   gCO2/passenger/mile [EV Bus Freeway])

Submitted by David Goldman and Jose Perez on behalf of SacRT and YCTD.

- They ask for 24 zero emission 40-foot buses.
- YCTD has 48 vehicles, adding 12 new buses increases that by 25%!

   *Would any current or new ZEV shuttle/bus routes affect other shuttle/bus
   service providers? If so how?*

   No

1. Existing Service

This is a blatant lie on the first page. Introducing the proposed service was
clearly going to eliminate the 30+ year old UC Davis Intercampus Shuttle which
has been contracted to All West Coach Lines Inc. since 2016.

   *a.ii. Please describe any relevant proposed programs or grant requests your
   organization may be pursuing that may affect your proposal*

   Any proposed programs or grant requests will not negatively affect this
   proposal and will only end up enhancing the viability of this project.

This is also a lie. This service depends on $700K annually from UC Davis as
well as grants from SACOG and the Air Resources Board.

   *a.vi. Would your fare structure change with an investment by Electrify
   America Green Cities in ZEV shuttle/bus? If so why?*

   For the UC Davis to Sacramento service, we foresee transitioning the fare
   structure for the existing service to one that more closely reflects the
   Partners fare structure for the following reasons:

   - As public agencies, we cannot limit ridership to select groups.
   - We plan to significantly enhance the current service provided by
     quadrupling the frequencies and providing clean, energy efficient buses to
     serve a very environmentally aware public.

They propose to quadruple frequency of the service, which would be 4 buses,
each way, from 5:30AM to 8:30PM. With only this grant, there is no way they can
even match the current service level.

   *b.i. Detail your organizations timeline for the proposed use case*

   Key dates for the ZEV project include (as stated above, CNG buses will be
   utilized in the interim until the zero-emission buses and infrastructure is
   available):

   - Project commencement - April 2018
   - Bid Award - September/October 2018
   - Implementation of service - November 2018*
   - Introduction of ZEVs to service - September 2019

   * Pending the discontinuation of the contract with the current service provider.

The service was not implemented in November 2018. As of Jan 1, 2020, the
service will start (with ZEVs) on April 6th, 2020. This is 1.5 years later than
proposed. It is important to note that the riders were officially informed of
the upcoming change in November 2019, 1 year after the supposed start date. We
have never seen CNG bus on the route.

   *b.ii. Detail your organizations key delivery milestones for proposed use
   case*

   1. Project Approval: April 2018
   2. Environmental Documentation: April-June 2018
   3. Environmental Approvals: April-June 2018
   4. Consultant Selection: June-Oct 2018
   5. Implementation of Service: November 2018 (Interim CNG Vehicles)
   6. Engineering: Sept-Dec 2018
   7. Acquisition of Properties: N/A

   9. Advertise, Bid Process: June-Sept 2018
   10. Award Bid: Sep-Oct 2018
   11. Notice to Proceed: Sep-Oct 2018
   12. Issue Purchase Order - Sep-Oct 2018
   13. Construction Administration: Jan-Sep 2019
   14. Construction: Apr-Sep 2019
   15. Project Acceptance/Testing: Sep 2019
   16. Introduction of ZEVs to Service: Sep 2019

   * This schedule assumes funding is awarded in April.

Apparently none of these milestones were met.

   *c.i. Would any current or new ZEV shuttle/bus routes affect other
   shuttle/bus service providers?  If so how?*

   We do not foresee our proposed routes adversely affecting any other service
   provider. In fact, there will be positive impacts on other transit providers
   by increasing the prevalence of public transit ridership in general and
   improving connectivity of the regional transit system. Also, as the largest
   transit operators in the Capitol Region, funding from this grant would kick
   start the region's evolution to zero-emission technology for smaller transit
   operators to follow.

   University of California, Davis (UC Davis) currently runs a diesel bus
   shuttle between the main campus and the UC Davis Medical Center in
   Sacramento on an hourly basis. This service is contracted out to a third
   party and the contract is slated to end in the near future. A recent survey
   conducted by UC Davis found that the number one improvement riders wanted
   was increased frequencies. This project would enhance the current service by
   increasing frequencies to every 15 minutes and providing additional stops in
   West Sacramento and Downtown Sacramento.

UC Davis ran the shuttle service with UCD employees for many years. The UCD
owned buses were deemed unfit for service in 2015 and the associated UCD
employment positions associated with the service were eliminated. It is unknown
what happened to the affected employees. UCD then contracted All West Charters
Inc.  to provide the service since 2016 for ~$600K/year. This has employed a
new set of drivers from All West, some of which relied primarily on this route
for their income. This proposed service would eliminate their jobs and take
business from All West Inc. The contract with All West could be renewed and of
course it was slated to end in the future; don't all contracts?

"A recent survey conducted by UC Davis found that the number one improvement
riders wanted was increased frequencies." is a real doozy. UC Davis did perform
a survey ?sometime in 2017? by handing out paper forms to riders on the bus but
we believe that this claim that increased frequency was the #1 thing riders is
likely a lie that was written to fit the proposer's pre-conceived narrative.
Follow up surveys done by the shuttle riders and by UCD ITS showed no
indication of this as a primary need. UC Davis has not shared the results of
the survey they conducted.

This proposal says there will be additional stops in West Sacramento and
Downtown Sacramento. As of Jan 1, 2020 there are no West Sacramento stops.

   *c.ii. Would any current or new routes result in an overlap of service?  If
   so where and how?*

   This project would not result in an overlap of service; it would takeover
   existing low-frequency services and increase the frequencies dramatically,
   add stops at major employment, education, and population centers, and
   provide clean, energy efficient buses to serve a very environmentally aware
   public.

   ...

This is also a lie. It clearly would overlap with the existing Intercampus
Shuttle.

2. Fleet

   *a. Outline proposed area of investment by Electrify America Green Cities*

   ZEV buses and related infrastructure to operate two express bus service
   routes serving 1) UC Davis and Sacramento and 2) Sacramento International
   Airport and Downtown Sacramento. ...

The UCD Sacramento service is stated to be "express" here but the design
proposed was not express.

   *b. Would this proposed area of investment by Electrify America Green Cities
   replace ICE shuttle/bus, or be in addition to an existing fleet?*

   This investment will result in an addition to the Partner's existing bus
   fleets and is necessary for the expansion of service as outlined above. The
   12 electric buses for the UC Davis route running at 15 minute frequencies
   would replace the two diesel buses currently being used for hourly service
   by a third-party vendor.

Another claim of 15 minute frequencies. The service approved by SacRT and YCTD
do not have 15 minutes frequencies.


   *c. Provide proposed vehicle driving patterns including routes, miles,
   speeds, etc.*

   Project component 1: Approximately 23 mile express bus service route
   connecting UC Davis with West Sacramento, downtown Sacramento and UC Davis
   Medical Center via I-80 & US 50 (approximately 45 minute travel time, 75
   minutes during peak time).

   ...

How is it express if it connects UCD, West Sac, downtown Sac, and UCD Med
Center? The travel time for the existing express service is between 25 minutes
at non-peak and 90 minutes at peak depending on traffic congestion. These
estimates provided here are poor estimates, admittedly made by simply selecting
points on Google Maps by SacRT transit planners.

TODO : Attachment 1 has generalized maps.

   *Do you require a ZEV shuttle, ZEV bus or both?  Why?*

   The proposed service will require 40 foot ZEV buses due to the following
   reasons:
   1) The in-service ranges of smaller ZEVs are significantly lower than the 40
   foot buses, which would necessitate more frequent out-of service charging
   and additional buses to be purchased to run the service as proposed.
   2) The cost of the smaller buses with less passenger capacity is not
   significantly less than those of the larger buses, thus increasing the cost
   per passenger appreciably.
   3) The current (500 passengers per day) and projected ridership (1,727 per
   day in year 1 to 2,110 passengers per day by year 12) is expected to exceed
   the capacity of a smaller bus (assuming one bus every 15 minutes).

They claim there are 500 passengers per day at the time of submission. There
are actually at least 400 passenger trips per day according to the flawed rider
counts. It isn't clear how they plan to quadruple ridership on this service in
one year. There is nothing to back up this projection.

TODO : Attachment 2 has projected costs of buses.

   *Do you recommend a specific ZEV shuttle/bus manufacturer? Why?*

   Based on our research into this technology and experience with different bus
   manufacturers, we have narrowed down the feasible choices to the following
   manufacturers:
   1) New Flyer Industries
   2) Gillig
   3) Proterra
   4) Green Power
   5) BYD

   We prefer New Flyer Industries for the following reasons:
   1) They have a proven heavy duty bus platform with significant experience in
   the ZEV market.
   2) Their heavy duty transportation vehicles have millions of miles of
   proven, reliable service.  Reliability is vital to keeping costs of
   operation under control.
   3) Their fleets are operating in multiple California locations.
   4) They have indicated that they are capable of producing buses within 18
   months while other manufacturers have informed us that it would take two
   years or longer to produce the needed vehicles.

   If New Flyer Industries buses are not available for any reason, Gillig, LCC
   would be an acceptable alternative due to reliability, seamless integration
   with existing fleet parts/resources, and operator experience with the
   company's buses.

Interestingly New Flyer was not chosen and thus the buses would take 2 years to
manufacturer. Even the second choice wasn't chosen. Proterra Inc. was chosen
for some later reason.

   *Would any current or new ZEV shuttle/bus routes affect other shuttle/bus
   service providers?  If so how?*

   We do not foresee our proposed routes adversely affecting any other service
   provider. In fact, there will be positive impacts on other transit providers
   by increasing the prevalence of public transit ridership in general and
   improving connectivity of the regional transit system. Also, as the largest
   transit operators in the Capitol Region, funding from this grant would kick
   start the region's evolution to zero-emission technology for smaller transit
   operators to follow.

   University of California, Davis (UC Davis) currently runs a diesel bus
   shuttle between the main campus and the UC Davis Medical Center in
   Sacramento on an hourly basis. This service is contracted out to a third
   party and the contract is slated to end in the near future. A recent
   survey conducted by UC Davis found that the number one improvement riders
   wanted was increased frequencies. This project would enhance the current
   service by increasing frequencies to every 15 minutes and providing
   additional stops in West Sacramento and Downtown Sacramento.

"It is proposed that UCD agree to guarantee that any shortages in the budgeted
$200,000 in fare revenue be covered by the university." pg 5

"On the capital side, new vehicle and parts related capital costs (estimated at
nearly $12 million for the 12 buses and an undisclosed amount for the charging
infrastructure) are fully funded by Electrify America (EA), and EA is absorbing
all costs associated with building the charging infrastructure to operate these
battery/electric buses." pg 5

"New vehicle costs are fully funded by Electrify America (EA) through the
Cooperative Agreement approved by the Board of Directors on September 24, 2018.
The service would total approximately 13,500 revenue hours per year, split
approximately evenly between SacRT and YCTD." -- pdf pg 90
