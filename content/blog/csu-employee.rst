I started my new job as a Research Associate/Fellow at Cleveland State
University Monday. I had to fill out some standard paperwork the first morning
over in HR. Turns out Ohio state employees don't pay into Social Security
because of the pension system in place, so I had to sign a paper forfeiting my
social security payments. The other papers were tax forms, ethics and fraud
reporting, Viking card (employee card), direct deposit for payroll, personal
data, etc. This took less than an hour and the folks were nice.

After that you need to get hooked up to the computer systems. So I called 5050
to get a temporary internet password and then logged into
`campusnet.csuohio.edu <http://campusnet.csuohio.edu>`_. Where the system asks
you to set a backup email and a new password.

I then forwarded my email to my gmail account (they use Microsoft Outlook 365
internally...blah! You can access that at `mail.csuohio.edu
<http://mail.csuohio.edu>`_ if you want to.)

At this point I can log into the wireless network and have library access and
such. In Ubuntu I connected to the `4csuuseonly` SSID and needed the following
settings for the WPA2 Enterprise. The tech support folks in 1106 Rhoades Tower
were very helpful with this even though the phone support lady had no idea what
I should do on Linux.

The library has access to lots of digital and physical media through `OhioLink
<http://www.ohiolink.edu/>`_ which is cool.

You dial `8` first on the campus phones to dial out and just dial the last 4
digits for campus numbers.

The `phone.csuohio.edu <http://phone.csuohio.edu>`_ directory is helpful for
tracking down email addresses and phone numbers of folks on campus.

Only one negative so far. The Campus Rec center seems to be the only place on
campus that has a shower. I'd love to have the option to freshen up after some
of my more sweaty bicycle rides to campus (btw, the bicycle ride is pretty
nice, I lucked up and get to ride on Cleveland's solitary bicycle lane for much
of the way), but they want $26 a month to use the bathroom. Duh! Where are the
incentives to ride you bike! The boss man at the rec center wasn't interested
in any fee reductions. I guess it is better than the $70 monthly parking fee...
but not that much better!
