My good friend, Tai Stillwater, studied driver feedback for his `PhD work
<http://pubs.its.ucdavis.edu/download_pdf.php?id=1518>`_ and now as a post doc
at the `UCD Institute for Transportation Studies <http://its.ucdavis.edu>`_.
He's got some good ideas and data to back up that people will change their
energy use behavior in their vehicle if provided the right kind of feedback,
even the most unlikely folks.

He's roped me into helping him develop an app for the US Governments new `Apps
For Vehicles Challenge <http://appsforvehicles.challenge.gov/>`_. We worked on
the presentation this past weekend of a simple but potentially effective app
that will help game-ify fuel economy and give the driver of any vehicle feedback
that will help them improve their fuel economy. It has a simple visualization
of the underlying data so that end-users find it fun and easy to use.

Checkout the screencast below showing how the app will work.
