I lived in the Netherlands from August 2008 to August 2009 and many of my
friends that have visited or moved there since then have asked for my
recommendations on what to do and see. This post gives a rundown of what I
thought was the most interesting things there. This is all circa 2008/9 so
things may not exist anymore. I'll update this as I remember more.

I kept a bicycle themed blog back then that may mention some good spots to
visit: http://moorebicycles.blogspot.com/.

Amsterdam
---------

- `De Pepper <https://depeper.org/>`_ is a cool vegan restaurant in `Overtoom
  301 <http://www.ot301.nl>`- (at art and community center)
- Zaal 100 on De Wittenstraat: food and music
- Cool urban farm with restaurant in Amsterdam: http://www.buurtboerderij.nl/
- All kinds of bottled beers can be purchased at De Bierkoning.
- The Brouerij 't IJ is a cool small batch organic brewery that is in windmill.
- `Biercafe Gollem <http://cafegollem.nl/>`_ on Raamsteeg was the coolest bar
  for all kinds of beers and there is a bottle shop across the street.
- Check out one of the two Workcycles shops for awesome cargo bikes. Workcycles
  is run by Henry Culter, an American expat.
- Macbike is a big bicycle rental company.
- Have a look at all the bicycle parking around the station, including the
  floating bike parking on the riverside.
- If you take one of the ferries out the back of the central station there is a
  cool space with these funky bars. I forget the details.
- The flea markert at Waterloopplein is interesting.
- Vondelpark is a nice place to relax.
- The Rijksmuseum is sweet. Check out the bicycle paths that go under the
  museum.

Delft

- Trappisten Lokaal 'T Klooster (my favorite bar in Delft)
- Locus Pulibcus is my second favorite bar. Get a cheese plate and a
  Westveleteren 12.
- Wolbodo is a eclectic student frat that serves cheap good meals most days.
  Lots on interesting people.
- Be sure to visit Theo Jansen's straandbeesten workshop just outside Delft. He
  also is often on the beach at Scheveningen testing out his beach animals.
- TU Delft is cool to visit, especially the industrial design department.
- There is a bicycle repair shop staff by mentally disabled people that is
  cool...forget the name.
- I always like visiting the graffiti underpass near the train station.

Den Haag
--------

- Water en Brood is a cool vegan restaurant. It was in the Piraat Bar squat.
- My favorite food in all of Delft is from the New Mevya
  `<http://www.newmeyva.nl/>`_. I would always get the vegetarian roti special.
  Super good.
- If you are into weed, the best coffee house is Cremers on Prinsestraat.
- `Beer Transportfietsen <http://www.beerfietsen.nl/beerfietsen>`_ is a great
  cargo bike shop.

  squat on the river.
