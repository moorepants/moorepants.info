{% mark excerpt %}

In 2009, Mont Hubbard, Ronald A. Hess, Dale L. Peterson, and I were awarded
$300K for a two year grant_ from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to study
how people are able to balance on bicycles. We completed the work in September
2012 after an additional one year no-cost extension. This resulted in numerous
research products that have been well cited since the completion of the work.

In 2011, US Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) released a report entitled "`The National
Science Foundation: Under the Microscope`_" with the intention to expose
wasteful spending of US tax dollars by the NSF. The grant we were awarded was
listed as one of the examples of "silly research". This received a fair amount
of media attention and we were interviewed for a number of publications to
comment on this report, e.g. in `IEEE Spectrum`_.

Then again in 2014, US Assemblyman Lamar Smith (R-TX), the chair of the House's
Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, `launched an investigation`_ into
NSF's wasteful spending, also bringing our grant and work back into the
spotlight.

My colleagues and I have responded to various media inquiries but never
developed a statement in our own words that reflects our opinion on this
matter. Now 4.5 years later, this past week a journalist contacted us with this
question:

  Hi Professor Hubbard,

  I'm a reporter with <redacted> writing on the implications of the Scientific
  Research in the National Interest Act (HR 3293). I'm highlighting interesting
  research that lawmakers decried as a misuse of federal funds and came upon
  your NSF-funded research about how people ride bikes. I was wondering if you
  knew of any instances of your findings from that study being used in a
  meaningful way, perhaps by cities to decongest roads and increase bike
  ridership or something along those lines. I'd love to include it in my piece.

  Thanks for your time!

  Best,

  <redacted>

This request prompted us to formulate some responses. In particular, I finally
found a moment to put some thoughts to paper. The letter below is my and Mont's
response to this journalist that we believe summarizes our opinion on the
continued attacks by some Congress members on the NSF:

  <redacted>,

  Thank you for your inquiry. Yes, our NSF funded research has been targeted in
  the past by some  members of Congress that consider it to have been a waste
  of money. You asked if we "knew of any instances of [our] findings from that
  study being used in a meaningful way, perhaps by cities to decongest roads
  and increase bike ridership". This question suggests that you may have the
  same misunderstanding about our research as some members of Congress do.

  The primary purpose of our research was to develop experimentally validated
  mathematical models that accurately predict the interaction between, and
  motion of, a human and the vehicle they are controlling. We chose the bicycle
  because it is one of the more dynamically complex vehicles humans learn to
  control and because it is a familiar, inexpensive, and tractable experimental
  platform (e.g. it is orders of magnitude cheaper than buying a F-22 Raptor
  and performing experiments with it, yet you get similarly meaningful
  results).

  In the four and a half years since our NSF grant ended, our research has
  influenced the robotics, vehicle dynamics, manual control, vehicle safety,
  sports engineering, biomechanics, and system identification research
  communities, which can be seen by the more than one hundred of citations to
  our research products. Additionally, the results of our NSF funded work have
  played roles in the progress of a number of companies, some of which have
  employed the 10+ graduate and undergraduate students that were involved the
  NSF funded research. We also speculate that a long-term, broader impact of
  our work may specifically affect future bicycle, scooter, and motorcycle
  designs that could contribute to our country's transportation needs.

  But, as with many of the congressionally targeted studies, there seems to be
  a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of the questioned research. NSF
  requires applicants to write a broader impact statement and this ends up as
  fully a third of the publicly visible grant abstract, whereas it is often
  only a very small component of the work and deliverables specified in the
  full proposal. This abstract is what a congressional aide may typically read.
  We do believe that our research will eventually play a role in the broader
  impacts we wrote, but it is much too soon to know for certain and further
  work must be done to ensure the impact. Also, as with any research, we may be
  wrong and our broader impacts may not come to fruition. It would not be
  called research if that risk were not present.

  One story that needs to be written is about the NSF's inability to properly
  communicate science to the public and Congress and the corresponding
  misunderstanding of science that the public and Congress seem to have. The
  scientific process is a remarkable one that thrives on vehemently eliminating
  untruth. Because there are only a few scientists in Congress, little to no
  experience with this process is present. This lack of experience contributes
  to the lack of trust in the funding, results, and reliability of science. NSF
  could obviously be doing a better job convincing Congress of its merit.

  Another story could include the fact that the broader impacts section of NSF
  grants is often a meaningless statement to fulfill a checkbox that is rarely
  actually delivered. For example, many robotics grants cite that their robots
  will help in search and rescue missions in natural disasters, just to pander
  to the popular sentiment that this is a good use of research funds. Yet few
  robots are developed for that specific purpose. You could just count the
  number of papers and grants that claim this to find out if the robot ended up
  in any actual applied search and rescue missions.

  Obtaining a NSF grant is a highly competitive process. Only about 20% of
  proposed grants are awarded. Once the NSF establishes its research
  directions, the competitive review process is one of the most thorough to be
  found, in which national experts are gathered to critically screen the
  submitted proposals over several  days. We agree that there may be some small
  percentage of past NSF proposals that this careful process overlooked that
  might have eventually benefited society more than the ones chosen. But we
  feel this percentage is so small that it does not provide any evidence that
  NSF's system is poor or broken. We have high confidence that virtually all
  funded NSF research grants are worthy of being funded.

  Funding scientific research is not like going to Walmart to buy a "whatzit".
  Our present unfunded research has continued along the lines originally begun
  in our NSF grant. Specifically, we are now researching the process of optimal
  design of bicycles (which actually is something of a whatzit). This present
  research was enabled by the prior NSF grant and is an entirely meaningful
  contribution resulting from the NSF's support.

  We sincerely hope that your article will highlight the disconnect between the
  House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the scientists and
  engineers that NSF funds. Just producing a tit for tat exchange on whether
  their targeted funded grants actually produced something is missing the most
  important point.
