{% mark excerpt %}

A team of our mechanical engineering students are going to be racing their
custom designed boat in the `Northern California Solar Regatta`_ on May 14th at
the `Rancho Seco Recreational Area`_. They will be racing against other
universities and colleges from Northern California. This is the first year a
team from the University of California, Davis will be competing. There will
also be camping, fishing, hiking, swimming, and picnicking activities along
with the competition and the location is just south of Sacramento making for a
nice day trip. Come out and support them!
