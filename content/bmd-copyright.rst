{% mark excerpt %}

Three of my papers got accepted to `BMD 2013 <http://bmd2013.org>`_ (two oral
presentations and one poster). I'm very elated about this as I only got a
poster presentation at the first BMD conference in 2010 and I will finally get
to talk about my dissertation work in front of my peers. My intention was to
submit papers that are reflections/enhancements of work presented in my
`dissertation <moorepants.github.io/dissertation>`_. The paper titles are:

{% endmark %}

- Identification of manual control employed during bicycling (poster)
- A review of steer torque measurement in bicycles and motorcycles (oral
  presentation)
- Identification of the open loop dynamics of a bicycle-rider system
  under manual control (oral presentation)

I thought the most interesting paper would be the manual control identification,
but it was selected as a poster. Maybe this was random since I submitted so
many papers.

I released the `abstracts <https://github.com/moorepants/BMD2013>`_ for the
conference and my dissertation under the `Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
Unported License <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/>`_ for ease of
reuse and all the source code that generates the dissertation is released under
BSD style licenses.

The BMD organizers have teamed up with the `Japanese Society of Automotive
Engineers <http://www.jsae.or.jp>`_ to help publish the proceedings of the
conference, but JSAE requires that you sign the copyright over to them. The
first BMD in 2010, on the other hand, just published the conference proceedings
themselves electronically under no copyright transfer agreements, which I found
to be a fantastic idea.

When I submitted my abstracts I expressed a desire to retain the copyright but
got no response, except the standard paper acceptance letter. So I emailed the
organizers specifically about this issue and got this response:

  Thanks for your message concerning about the copyright transfer. First of
  all, the BMD2013 abstract review is a peer review, and we need a copyright
  transfer form from the author to publish the full paper. If you submit the
  same full paper to other conference, it's a dual submission which is
  ethically illegal.

  Moreover, we would like to let you know that after the copyright of your full
  paper is transformed to JSAE, you have the right to put your paper on your
  homepage so that everybody can download. You may also use your figures, graphs
  or sentences on your other papers. You may not use the same paper to submit to
  other conferences which is ethically illegal.

  As you might know, since we are going to select several good full papers to
  recommend to a IAVSD Journal, it's a very good chance to submit full paper to
  BMD 2013. If that paper is selected, you can just modify some formats and add
  some, you can submit very similar paper to a journal.

  If you do not wish to transfer the copyright of your full paper, there are
  several options below.

  (1) Present all of your three papers as Panel.
      If you select this option, you have to submit camera ready copy of
      revised camera ready copy of two pages abstract, but you do not have to
      send copyright transfer form, since you are not going to submit full
      papers.

  (2) Withdraw your oral presentations

  (3) Present one for poster and two for oral by transfer copyright to JSAE for
      two papers.

  Since your paper titles "Identification of Manual Control ...." is selected
  as poster, there is no problem for copyright problem. You have submitted  two
  others, one is "Identification of the Open Loop Dynamics..." and other is "A
  review of steer torque measurement... " . We would like to know which of them
  you would like not to transfer your copyright?

  Anyway, we have already setup a provisional program, and we are going to send
  them to ISC member soon, and it's already on our web page. We will change the
  program after we will receive your final decision about this issue.

Some thoughts:

1. What does copyright have to do with peer reviewing? Does this mean that the
   publisher needs copyright to the work to allow other researchers to read it
   and provide suggestions for improvement? Or that the publisher needs
   copyright to modify the work? Neither of these are true.
2. I never told the organizers that I was interested in submitting the same
   paper to multiple conferences, but I find it funny that this is such an
   "ethically illegal" violation. Seems to me that if I do some science that is
   good, then ideally it should be disseminated as widely as possible.
   Presenting the same topic at multiple conferences should be encouraged not
   deemed as something unethical and definitely not something that is illegal.
3. The first option about a panel is the only one that is actually favorable to
   me in turns of being able to participate conference and to retain my
   copyright.

I sent this response to the organizers:

   Thank you for the response and the options. Before I choose one of your
   options I'd like to propose another option to see if you all and JSAE would
   be interested as I believe it is the most favorable option for all parties
   involved.

   Ideally I'd like to submit three full papers to the BMD conference for peer
   review and publishing in the conference proceedings, but I'd like to retain
   the copyright. I'm happy to release the papers under the Creative Commons
   Attribution License 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/).
   This legally binding license allows for sharing (copying, distributing, and
   transmission), remixing, and commercial use of the works and thus JSAE will
   have all of the legal right to publish and do what they will with my papers,
   including selling access to their final published form.

   I'd also like to note that I have no intention of submitting these papers to
   other conferences. But my intention is to submit the papers to BMD so that I
   can share the work in person with the BMD community. After the conference, I
   plan to submit these papers to an open access journal of my choosing for
   publishing. If I don't retain the copyright to these papers, then it will
   legally prevent me from publishing in my journal of choosing. I do not plan
   to submit to The International Association for Vehicle System Dynamics,
   regardless if my paper is chosen as exceptional, because they do not have a
   suitable Open Access publishing model for me.

I hope this 4th option can work out as it seems like the obvious best choice
for everyone.
