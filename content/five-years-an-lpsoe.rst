- Great idea to have teaching focused faculty
- get to meet an dinteract with tons of students
- need tas before class starts
- course evals aren't the right thing ot measure our success
- CEE super helpful
- LPSOE is second class
- Didn't honor teaching load
- Unclear merit and promotion, people hvve different thoughts
- pay is good
- surprised to get startup funds
- research faculty don't want to work wit hyou
- departments are not interested in innovation
- didn't know i had say in choosing classes

I am sitting in an old apartment in Delft waiting out my coronavirus
precautionary quarantine and eager to begin my new position at TU Delft. This is
a good time to reflect on the last five years I spent at UC Davis as an LPSOE.
The purpose of this post is to describe my experience with the LPSOE position
and the good, bad, and the ugly.

What is an LPSOE?
=================

LPSOE stands for "Lecturer with Potential Security of Employment". It is a job
title in the University of California system that intends to enable an academic
faculty member to focus on excellence in teaching and learning all while having
equivalent rights and benefits of that of an Assistant Professor that's primary
focus is research. The position hasn't been widely used at all campuses, but
many at UC Davis decided to significantly increase the use of the position
about 6 years ago. I was part of a cohort of quite a few LPSOEs to be hired in
2015. In particular, the College of Engineering hired one for each of the
departments in 2015-2016 with a mission to improve the College's teaching.

As far as I understood, an LPSOE was equivalent in all ways to any other Ladder
Rank Academic Senate Faculty: same pay scale, can obtain tenure, follows same
merit and promotion cycle, gets sabbaticals, senate voting rights, etc.  The
differences lie in what we are judged on for success and promotion. Instead of
Research/Teaching/Service, LPSOEs were judged on Teaching/Professional
Achievements and Activities/Service where "Professional Achievements and
Activities" could be a variety of things, including research. These are laid
out in the UC personnel manual in APM-285.

My situation
============

I started on September 21, 2015 and my last day was June 30, 2020. My 9 month
salary started at $84,600 and through merit raises and other systematic pay
raises ended at $XX,XXX. I was also given a $50k startup fund that was supposed
to be spent in 3 years, which was a surprise I wasn't expecting when I read the
offer letter.

UC Davis is on the quarter system; three quarters per academic year where
students take a minimum of 12 units per quarter. I taught seven different
existing courses over the five years, one of which was a graduate course.
Professors in the MAE department typically teach three 4 unit courses
per academic year.

- 2015-2016: five 4 unit courses (only one course the first quarter)
- 2016-2017: six 4 unit courses and one 1 unit course
- 2017-2018: six 4 unit courses
- 2018-2019: six 4 unit courses
- 2019-2020: five 4 unit courses

I passed two biennial merit reviews (with 1X and 1.5X advancements,
respectively), a tenure appraisal, and would have submitted my tenure package
the month I left if I had stayed. My merit candidate statements and logs of my
accomplishments can be found

The Good
========

The creation and wide use of a teaching focused faculty position is a really
good thing, especially for R1 universities. The primary reason this is good is
that it shifts the incentive structure so that people are rewarded for
excellence in teaching. For better or worse, a typical professor at an R1 is
systematically forced to minimize effort put into teaching to succeed. This
incentive structure is what drives R1's reputation for poor teaching. It was
refreshing being around the other LPSOEs because they were all so passionate
and dedicated to teach, whereas the traditional professors more often than not
seemed to treat teaching as a requirement.

The pay was very good, as far as I could tell. We were mostly paid as much as
the equivalent assistant professors and had several raises, merit and
systematic. Receiving the same benefits as professors, also made you feel like
you were valued, unlike typical pure-teaching roles in the US university system.

The administrators in College of Engineering wanted to see the LPSOEs succeed
and worked with us in numerous ways to help. I found the early connections to
the Center for Educational Effectiveness as one of the most valuable support
efforts. The CEE has hired a fantastic group of experts in teaching and
learning that worked with us individually, as groups, and financially to help us
succeed.
