Introduction
============

In our mechanical engineering curriculum, we teach a required upper level
mechanical engineering course entitled "Mechanical Design". This course is
primarily focused on teaching students how to apply theories of stress and
strain prediction to determine if arbitrary mechanical parts and structures are
likely to fail under static and dynamic loads. Students are also expected to
gain experience in conceptual design of a mechanical device and applying the
learned failure theories to prove its structural soundness. Traditionally, the
course has focused mostly on failure prediction and has provided students with
relatively less practical instruction on how to develop the mechanical design
concept.  Our goal, however, has been to give a primer on the conceptual design
process in the context of applying the failure theories that better prepares
them for the design methodologies taught in their followup capstone design
course.

It is worth noting that the only other design experience our students are
guaranteed to have before arriving to this class is the design of a simple
interlocking part in our prerequisite manufacturing class. That project is
designed such that the students learn how tolerances and communication are
essential to having parts that can be successfully integrated with another
designer's. The effort described in this article is part of a plan to provide
more design experiences throughout our curriculum.

For the past two years, we have had the students design a bicycle rack which
attaches to the front of a transit bus. The rack has to meet `certain stated
specifications and should withstand specified static and dynamic loads
<http://moorepants.github.io/eme150a/pages/project-part-two-unitrans-bicycle-rack-design.html#design-needs>`__.
We have introduced the following interactive design activities to help students
shape their conceptual design:

#. Research and reverse engineering of existing bicycle rack technologies.
#. Need and specification development with an informative visit to the local
   bus maintenance facility.
#. Concept generation.
#. Lightweight prototyping.
#. Concept selection.
#. Static failure modeling and analysis.
#. Dynamic failure modeling and analysis.

   front end of the bus.

This year was the first year that we introduced the 4th step in the above list,
lightweight prototyping, with the goal of broadening the tools and methods
students can use during the design process. The learning objectives for the
in-class activity were multifold:

-  The students will be able to use rapid, cheap, and simple prototyping
   to evaluate their designs for form, function, and structural
   integrity.
-  Students will work in teams.
-  Students will perform a hands-on engineering activity.

Inspiration
===========

Initial ideas for this lesson were inspired by Olin College's "\ `Design Nature
<https://youtu.be/dbyI-P6Vz18>`__\ " course where freshman students design and
construct insect-influenced hopping machines out of simple materials. Our
college's new pilot first-year engineering course was also an influence. This
new course is structured around a hands-on design challenge in which the
students create a small manually operated machine. Both of these courses
implement project based learning with heavy emphasis on hands-on activities.
Education research points to improved retention, student satisfaction,
diversity, and student learning when these methods are employed [1]_ and that
prototyping results in more successful designs [2]_.

Goals
=====

Our hypothesis is that students are able to generate more effective designs
when they pair prototyping and testing with theoretical justification. Design
firms, especially in the industrial design and architectural realms, make heavy
use of physical prototypes to learn about a design's functionality and form.
These firms see lightweight prototyping as an essential component in creating
excellent designs.  Additionally, there are few successful mechanical designs
that exist where prototyping and testing has not played a critical role in
evaluating structural integrity.

Our goal is to evaluate the efficacy of creating what we call "lightweight
prototypes" early in the design process (concept generation and concept
selection phases). With inexpensive, yet realistically similar materials and
rapid construction methods scaled three dimensional functional prototypes can
quickly be created for difference concepts. These prototypes allow the designer
to see and feel things that cannot be easily sensed from CAD and mathematical
models, especially for students that have little past experience making
mechanical structures. These prototypes ideally help bridge the gap from theory
to reality.

Development
===========

To develop the prototyping activity, several sample prototypes were created
using different inexpensive materials, e.g. wood dowels, steel wires, aluminum
cans, foam poster boards, etc. In the end, the materials and tools provided for
the students were chosen after considering time constraints, safety, material
costs, simplicity, design flexibility, and the ability of the prototype to
predict failure modes. For example, although using metal would have provided a
more accurate representation of the bike racks' behavior, prototyping with
metal would require soldering, shearing, rolling, and bending tools and would
have been impractical for the allotted time and class space. For the activity
we settled on 1/8" wooden dowels, 1/8" thick balsa sheets, posterboard, large
steel paper clips, and large tongue depressors. We provided hot glue guns to
secure the materials together along with scissors, exacto knives, and a small
hack saw for cutting.

Implementation
==============

The week prior to the prototyping activity the students went through a concept
generation sketching process and were asked to select two of the complete
bicycle rack designs that they generated to construct prototypes of. Before the
prototyping lesson class period, they were asked to read the prototyping
chapter from the course text [3]_ and complete a short online quiz to assess
their understanding of the reading materials. We also prepared a handout with
instructions for the activity and photos of successful hot glue joints that
we'd previously experimented with which they received prior to the lesson.

The 110 minute class session began with a short description of prototyping to
help recall some of the reading material and a brief introduction to the
prototyping activity. The students were then provided with the materials
described above to realize a 1:10 scaled version of their two design sketches.
Pairs of students worked on each design. We also provided them a 1:10 scale
bicycle laser cut from thin steel to use as a reference prop.

At the end of the construction period, the scaled racks were attached to a
table with a C-clamp and tested for their ability to secure the bicycle both
static and dynamically, i.e. we shook the table. Secondly, we tested whether or
not the rack could withstand the maximum specified load applied to the worst
case location and checked for failure and deflection.

The Prototypes
--------------

The students were able to construct scaled bicycle racks that were structurally
similar to their sketches in the allotted time. Each group of four students
produced two prototypes in just under two hours. The upper photo shows an
example lightweight prototype and the lower photo shows the final CAD design
that this prototype inspired.

The Student's Opinion of the Activity
-------------------------------------

We surveyed the students after the activity and 91% of 12 responding students
stated that the prototyping activity revealed either good or bad qualities
regarding the function of their design, with 9% not sure.  None said no. Also,
91% felt that the activity improved the understanding of the structural
integrity of their designs (9% said no).  64% of the respondents said the
activity helped them decide between their two top designs, with 18% unsure and
18% stating it did not.  Finally, 45% said they would use lightweight
prototyping to evaluate designs in the future and 55% said maybe they would.

Many of the students were skeptical that the activity would offer anything to
the design process before the activity. For example, here are some selected
comments:

- "I was not really sure of how it will be helpful in analyzing the bike
  rack."
- "I was skeptical that we would learn much."

And after the activity there were more positive attitudes, with examples such
as:

- "I believe that it gave a very nice physical perspective of the actual
  object, whereas if we just jumped straight into CAD software, we would
  probably not have too much of an idea of the scale of the actual project."
- "It was a good fast way to get an initial idea of how different rack designs
  would fare under load in addition to seeing it in three dimensions."
- "I think it is extremely beneficial and a crucial part of the entire design
  process."

With only one comment being slightly negative:

- "I believe it has some value in terms of forcing the creator to take on the
  perspective of a machinist. That being said, I also feel that this type of
  lower-level designing has less applicability to our real-world applications."

Discussion
==========

We felt the prototyping activity was one of the highlights of the course. The
energy and enthusiasm we witnessed before and after class indicated that the
activity had a positive effect on the students. We were surprised at the number
of students that stayed after the prototyping lesson to continue working on
their design. This activity introduced many of the students to an additional
tool in the mechanical designer's tool belt that can be utilized to make design
and engineering decisions.

There is room for improvement, as always. The scaled prototypes would more
closely mimic their real counterparts with more careful choice of materials.
The available materials, in particular the wide popsicle sticks, constrained
some of the students' designs and they did not reflect their sketches as
accurately as we'd hoped. Additionally, more time is, as expected, needed to
pull this off. The students just barely finished the prototypes in time and we
ended up going over a bit to finish the testing.

Lastly, more structure is needed to evaluate the designs for form, function,
and structural integrity so that the students connect the activity to the
theory.
