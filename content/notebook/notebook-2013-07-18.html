Keys
====

I finally got my keys to the lab and break room!

Time accounting
===============

With my position I don't have to report hours but I do have to go to CSU's
mytime java app
(https://csuohio.kronos.net/wfc/applications/suitenav/navigation.do) to report
sick days and vacation days. These should be reported before the 2nd and 17th
of each month.

GSoC
====

I met with Tarun during my lunch hour. He is almost finished with the three
link conical pendulum example animation. He's got the static visualization
mostly working with correct translations and orientations. But the animation is
not working. He is a little behind schedule for the Python code milestone, but
I think he will be fine. If he can finish the example problem he will be in
good shape to finish the tests for the his class designs and can then start
implemented the code, which much of it will be transferring and cleaning the
code he's written in the example problem. I'm going to take a look at his code
to help find a bug that is preventing the animation from working. Once he get's
that it is just some minor details to finish the example. He weekly report blog
is here: http://tarun-gaba.blogspot.com/.

Install Matlab
==============

I installed Matlab so that I can run the simulations and made sure my code
works with the new 2013a version. Things seemed to work except my compare plots
from the sys id toolbox didn't properly print to file.

Other
=====

What a non-productive day. I spent almost 4 hours fussing with setting up my
computer from the wipe and talking with folks. I hope I can find some time to
acutally do some research soon...
