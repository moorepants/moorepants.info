Structural Model Identification
===============================

- 10 runs with the Boeing 747 (no process noise) ID

The one that will require a re-do of your algorithm will be the four original
tasks, this time with process noise ID.  Of course, if you can to the Boeing
747 also with process noise ID, that would be great.  Iâ€™m anxious to get the
paper uploaded to the AIAA website?

Each data file should have a plant identifier and a run number. The plants can
be loaded from the data file or from the plant.m file (given the plant number).

plant-01-run-01.mat

Plants

- 1 : 1 / s
- 2 : 1 / s(s + 1)
- 3 : 1 / s(s + 0.2)
- 4 : 10 / (s + 10)
- 5 : 5 / (s + 10)
- 6 : 10 / (s^2 +.2 * s)
- 7 : -5.2632(s-17.28) / (s^3+12.88s^2+77.92s)
- 8 : -5.7616(s-17.24) / (s^3+12.46s^2+74.24)

Not much progress here today...will have to work on it during next week.
