Purchasing
==========

The remaining POs for higher dollar items were turned into Patsy and I gave
her my reimbursement requests for the lower $ purchases.

Two more annoyances and wastes of time on purchasing:

- CSU has not mechanism to purchase from Newegg.com who doesn't do purchase
  orders. Why isn't there a college or department credit card for this stuff?
- I'm trying to order the computers but because our grant budget has no special
  category for computers, then we can't orderd them until the account is
  rebudgeted. This takes a form and signature from Ton and he is out of town
  till the 13th. The computers take 2-4 weeks to get in from IT & S so we will
  likely not have the computers for 2.5-3 months after we decided to get them.

I'm quickly getting frustrated with purchasing stuff and the amount of wasted
time dealing with it. I thought UC Davis was bad, but man CSU is worse off.
The ideal situation would be to have a credit card for purchases under a
certain amount that would be linked to a grant account, then I can go to
vendors and purchase as needed. But this removes the approval step which I
doubt the University would give up. UCD CoE had a decent online purchasing
system put in a few years back that alleviates much of the wasted time. I'm
trying to track down what that is.

Structural Model Identification
===============================

From Ron:

  I need the identified gains for Task 2, no K estimation.  This is one of  the
  runs that you did while you were still in Davis.  I seem to have misplaced
  these results that you emailed me.

  What I have recorded for the identified gains are:  K1 = 14.4, K2 = .284, K3 =
  1.02 and K4 = 121.8.  The K4 value looks suspicious. I may have transcribed it
  incorrectly.  Do you have them available?

These are likely results from Matlab 2010a, which I used for all the previous
analysis. But I don't have access to that version anymore and 2013a gives
different results (WTF!)::

  Plant #2,  Run #1, K estimated: no
  Best ARX [na=3, nb=1, nk=24]
  The order of the closed loop system is 8.
  The gain guesses: k1=14.500000, k2=0.375000, k3=1.000000, k4=20.000000
  The identified gains: k1=41.742796+\-1.496914, k2=1.241115+\-0.005499,
  k3=1.466902+\-0.000640, k4=10.349165+\-0.149289

I'm not sure what to do about this. Maybe Ron can run the code on his previous
versions of Matlab.

Here is the results I got from Matlab 2010a on June 18, 2013 with the same code::

  Plant #2,  K estimated: no
  Best ARX [na=1, nb=3, nk=3]
  The order of the closed loop system is 8.
  The gain guesses: k1=14.500000, k2=0.375000, k3=1.000000, k4=20.000000
  The identified gains: k1=34.679381+\-0.532964, k2=1.100302+\-0.002407,
  k3=1.255370+\-0.000265, k4=9.427437+\-0.071185

I need to check and make sure I'm actually using the original data Ron sent me,
because he has an even different set of numbers.

Plone
=====

I made it through chapter 7. A few more chapters and I'll be ready to setup a
site that has a version control configuration based on my dev environment.
Tomorrow is theming so we can work on implementing Sandy's design once I go
through that chapter.

Source for the practice stuff is here: https://github.com/moorepants/optilux,
including notes on installing on Ubuntu 13.04.
