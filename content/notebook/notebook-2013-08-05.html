Amazon Web Services
===================

Woohoo! Looks like Amazon can invoice us and I finally turned in all the
purchasing papers to make this happen. Maybe I'll have the website online by
the end of the week.

Matlab
======

I requested a quote for 5 academic group licenses with 4 toolboxes but the rep
is on vacation so this may not come back till next week.

MGView
======

Adam Leeper released MGView under the MIT license today so Tarun and I are
looking into potentially using it for pydy-viz and giving our efforts to
contributions to the project. See his repo on github:
https://github.com/mgview/mgview

Plone
=====

I finished Chapter 8 but hit a bug which I'm trying to get an answer to on the
Plone user's mailing list. Martin replied, so I'll probably get to the bottom
of it.

I started a mockup using bootstrap and html5 boilerplate for the new site theme:

   :class: img-rounded

The code for the theme is here: https://github.com/moorepants/hmc.theme

Structural Model
================

Ron sent me the first set of data on August 20, 2013. I made sure that my
renamed data file `plant_02_run_01.mat` is the same file, it is.

The first time (Jan 14, 2013) I sent solutions for the 4 gain model, plant #2
[Matlab 2010a]::

  Plant #2,  K estimated: no
  Best ARX [na=6, nb=1, nk=22]
  The order of the closed loop system is 8.
  The gain guesses: k1=14.500000, k2=0.375000, k3=1.000000, k4=20.000000
  The identified gains: k1=41.743034+\-1.496923, k2=1.241126+\-0.005499,
  k3=1.466906+\-0.000640, k4=10.349137+\-0.149286

Here is the results I got from Matlab 2010a on June 18::

  Plant #2,  K estimated: no
  Best ARX [na=1, nb=3, nk=3]
  The order of the closed loop system is 8.
  The gain guesses: k1=14.500000, k2=0.375000, k3=1.000000, k4=20.000000
  The identified gains: k1=34.679381+\-0.532964, k2=1.100302+\-0.002407,
  k3=1.255370+\-0.000265, k4=9.427437+\-0.071185

And now with Matlab 2013a::

  Plant #2,  Run #1, K estimated: no
  Best ARX [na=3, nb=1, nk=24]
  The order of the closed loop system is 8.
  The gain guesses: k1=14.500000, k2=0.375000, k3=1.000000, k4=20.000000
  The identified gains: k1=41.742796+\-1.496914, k2=1.241115+\-0.005499,
  k3=1.466902+\-0.000640, k4=10.349165+\-0.149289

Looks like I got the same answer on Jan 14 2013 with Matlab 2010a and now with
Matlab 2013a. I'm not sure what was different on the June 18 results. None of
these match Ron's 12.84 number for the K4 gain. I'm not sure where that number
is coming from.
