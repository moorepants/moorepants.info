Simon Grant's Manual Control Thesis
===================================

This pop science article appeared yesterday:

http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/07/mysteries-bicycle

It is nothing new, but it had lots of comments, most all of which were the
continual misunderstanding of bicycle dynamics and stability, but one comment
was interesting:

  I did a fair amount of related research during my PhD around 1988, and would
  be happy to give anyone a good idea of how humans control bicycles, if you're
  really interested... -- Simon Grant

I Google his name and found this:

http://www.simongrant.org/pubs/thesis/index.html

in which he has work on manual control tasks, including his SUV...Simple
Unstable Vehicle (i.e. a bicycle). There is some experimental work that may be
interesting. I'll have to read more when I get time.

To archive his web version I used::

  wget -H -r --level=5 --no-parent -k -p http://www.simongrant.org/pubs/thesis/

Zotero
======

I reinstalled Zotero. My database was lost in my computer wipe though. It
didn't have much in it anyways, so that isn't too big a deal. But luckily I
lost my Mendely database too!! I was dreading having to write some scripts to
extract all my data from Mendely for a Zotero import, so this data loos solved
that problem. Bye-bye Mendeley (and Elsevier)!

Install instructions for the latest Zotero on Ubuntu 13.04::

   $ cd ~/Downloads
   $ wget http://download.zotero.org/standalone/4.0.9/Zotero-4.0.9_linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
   $ tar -jxvf Zotero-4.0.9_linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
   $ sudo cp -r Zotero_linux-x86_64/ /opt/zotero
   $ vim ~/.local/share/applications/zotero.desktop

Paste this in::

   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=Zotero
   GenericName=Reference Manager
   Comment=Open-source reference manager (standalone version)
   Exec=/opt/zotero/zotero
   Icon=/opt/zotero/chrome/icons/default/default48.png
   Type=Application
   StartupNotify=true
   Categories=Office

And add an alias in my .bashrc::

   alias zotero=/opt/zotero/zotero

I then installed the Firefox extension and it asks if I want to link to the
standalone Zotero, which I said yes too.

BMD Coyright
============

See `<bmd-copyright.html>`_.

Plone Bug
=========

I found the bug:

https://github.com/moorepants/optilux/commit/0f61fd826c48f2b212c84a1ba0e365e8e1041f91

Just had an extra `>`.

AWS Webserver
=============

I have a live Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit server running on a micro instance. Time
to install Plone so we can start adding some content to the web site.

Walking System ID
=================

Worked out the maths for the linear least squares. Will post tomorrow.
