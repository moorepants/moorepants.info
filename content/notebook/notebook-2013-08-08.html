Plone
=====

I got the website running on the server today. Been taking detailed notes which
will be pushed to a github repo soon.

I went with the option of installing Plone with the unified installer on the
server and I plan to overwrite the default buildout config files with the ones
I've been developing with Aspeli's book so that I have control over the
details. But damn Plone is a hug nasty mess with so many freaking settings and
options. I don't know how anyone keeps it all straight unless they do this
every day of their lives. I hope it is all worth it. I really like using Plone
and have good experiences in the past with it, but developing it is another
story. Seems like you could write a Plone CloneÂ® with a modern web app
framework and drop all this old baggage. I assume it isn't an easy thing to do
though since noone has done it.

GSoC
====

Tarun's merged most of his Python code. He just needs a little more work on the
Scene.display() method. He's also started on his Javascript API design and will
be posting that soon. We also discussed the merits of using all or some of
MGView as it is very similar to what we have in mind. Adam Leeper has been
super helpful discussing his software and there may be room for some future
collaboration, but we decided to push forward with rolling our own until we see
how that collaboration may be forged. We also talked about adding a method to
our Scene class that will output the MGView input files so we can just use
MGView as is.
