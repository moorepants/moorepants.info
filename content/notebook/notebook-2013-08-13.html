Today's task list:

- [x] Work on parsing the walking data
- [] Make generic settings on the lab website
- [] Work on the website theme
- [] Fix the budgeting and purchasing issues
- [] Review the TODO items on the Yeadon paper
- [] Run variations in guesses for structural id

Walking System Identification
=============================

#. Load data.
#. Find the heel strike and toe-off for each foot for the run.
#. Align each foot down section in time with the first one and truncate the
   data for each to have equal length time series for each foot down.
#. Segment and truncate the interesting time series to match (rates, angles, etc)
#. Specify the number of time steps to retain for the control extraction.
#. Store these reduced time series in a 3D array. This can be a pandas Panel
   where each DataFrame in the Panel is one foot down time series. There should
   be one Panel for each leg.
#. Find the mean of the time series and store as the limit cycle definition.
#. Specify the inputs and outputs to the controller.
#. Form Ax=b.
#. Call linear least squares to get the gains.

The math for forming Ax=B: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6226636 and the gist:

I also got the data loaded in an cleaned of missign values and found the mean
time series.

Now I just need to transform these things into a nice API where the user can
select the data source, the names of the controls and sensors, and it will find
the gains. Nice and general.
