Motek Training
==============

The Lua scripting environment.

D-Flow Feature Requests

- feature request: output mox files to hdf5 instead
- support python alongside of lua because of the abundance of scientific code
- allow scripting outside the d-flow loop, ie.e start stop the loop, init code
  outside of it
- include the Lua interpreter in the script module window for interactive
  debugging
- Allow Lua scripts to be run and debugged outside of D-Flow
- Introduce extensive keyboard shortcuts for interacting with modules.

Bugs

- Any top layer D-Flow related window does not gt hidden when you select
  windows that are behind it.

Walking System Identification
=============================

Ton's idea is to identify both the phase dependent gain matrix *and* the
"commanded" gait cycle. I didn't understand the idea about identifying the
commanded gait cycle (angles and rates) and still don't know if I understand
what it means conceptually. But I think the problem now becomes non-linear.

\\[m(t) = K(t) [s_{lc}(t) - s(t)]\\]

If we measure \\(m(t)\\) and \\(s(t)\\) and want to solve for \\(K(t)\\) and
\\(s_{lc}(t)\\) then things look non-linear:

\\[m(t) = K(t) s_{lc}(t) - K(t)s(t)\\]

But Ton was writing it like:

\\[m(t) = A(t) - K(t)s(t)\\]

If we have:

- \\(n\\) time samples in a cycle
- \\(m\\) cycles
- \\(p\\) sensors
- \\(q\\) controls

Then for one cycle:

- \\(K\\): \\(q \\times p\\)
- \\(s\\): \\(p \\times 1\\)
- \\(s_{lc}\\): \\(p \\times 1\\)
- \\(m\\): \\(q x 1\\)

\\(A\\) is then shape \\(q \\times 1\\) so we could solve for the entries of \\(A\\)
and not for \\(s_{lc}\\) explicitly. Then at each time step in a cycle we have
\\(q + qp\\) unknowns giving \\(nq(1 + p)\\) unknowns for a cycle and thus need
that many equations. Each cycle gives us \\(nq\\) equations so we need at least
\\(1 + p\\) cycles to solve for the entries of \\(A\\) and \\(K\\).
