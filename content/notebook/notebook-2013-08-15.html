Motek Training
==============

We learned how to make scenes today. Turns out that Motek uses the open source
graphic library, Ogre, in their software. So you can create Orge files that can
be loaded into the visualization.

I figured out how to edit the human models in the installation. Most everything
is exposed to manipulate them but it would be much easier if we had the files
for whatever 3D software these use to edit them. But it may be possible to
convert the Ogre files to Blender files and then edit the model.

Obinna and Sandy got a hamster wheel visualization running which is tied to the
treadmill speed, which was pretty cool. They imported the hamster wheel from
the Sketchup warehouse.

Notes on the session are here:

Tarun was sick today so we postponed our meeting until he's better.
