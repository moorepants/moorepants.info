Walking System ID
=================

Latest maths notebook: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6226636
Latest data analysis notebook: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6311280

The sparse methods for linear least squares in scipy are significantly slower
than the normal method and only give approximate solutions. The lsqr method
took 5 minutes as opposed to 30 seconds for the example data set. My A matrix
is very sparse, so I thought the sparse methods would be faster. I probably
need to construct the A matrix as a sparse matrix data type:

http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html

For the sparse algorithms to work.

I went over the project with Sandy and she's going to start thinking about how
to excite the subject with lateral random motions while they are walking so we
can obtain richer datasets.

BMD Papers
==========

Work has started on the Whipple ID paper:

SymPy Dev
=========

We've about got tests runing on the NiPy buildbot for slow, no cache, and
external dependencies. If we can figure out how to run them on each pull
request commit, then we can remove the slow downs from Travis (they have a 50
minute time limit). But the solution may still be to break up the test suite.

Test script for buildbot:

Trying to reduce the time on Travis with matplotlib deps:

GSoC
====

Tarun's going to start writing the javascript source for his single Canvas
class. Everything looks pretty good and we got jasmine test mostly running on
Travis:
