Lab Notebook
============

I wasted way too much time today trying to automate my notebook blog creation
today with make. I finally switched to fabric and got it working in a 15
minutes. The virtues of python...(or working with something you know).

Lab Website
===========

I made a github org for our lab: https://github.com/csu-hmc

And moved the three plone repos to it.

I tried pulling down the buildout.cfg from the server unified installer but ran
into issues building from the develop.cfg file. Tired of looking at it...

Not much accomplished today except getting a headache from Plone backend admin.
