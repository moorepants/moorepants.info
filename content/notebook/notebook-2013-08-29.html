Plone 4.3 Backup
================

I ended up using the backup script that is included in the UnifiedInstaller to
backup the Data.fs and the blob storage. It is a nice wrapper to the repozo
script and does a little more. I also added this `nice utility
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.recipe.backup>` to my production
buildout file to add the script to cron::

  ############################################
  # Runs the backup scripts only on the server
  [backupcronjob]
  recipe = z3c.recipe.usercrontab
  times = 1 3 1,16 * *
  command = ${buildout:directory}/bin/backup

The ``backupcronjob`` must also be added to the ``parts`` list in the
``[buildout]`` section. It worked like a charm.

The next step is to make some copies to an S3 bucket so we have a dual backup.
This tool http://s3tools.org/s3cmd looks like a nice option to make that easy.

Info on basic Plone backups are here:

Plone Theming
=============

We figured out how to use the new Plone theme editor and started learning how
to apply Diazo rules. It seems to be simple but making sure you map everything
that is needed will take some time. We wasted a lot of time trying rules with
no result in the inspectors until we realized you had to press "Preview Theme"
to see the result of the rules.

I also refactored the theme into a Plone product:

Still some work to do there to clean up all the links in index.html.
