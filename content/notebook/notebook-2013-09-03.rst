Walking System Identification
=============================

I've been using Pandas DataFrames to manage the walking time series data and it
generally seems to be working well. But I had a bug that's been holding me up
on parsing the data. Turns out it was related to the fact that D-Flow returns
data at variable sample rates, even if you try to pull in the data "directly"
from the Cortex mocap software. The hideously huge csv files that D-Flow spits
out have a column for a time stamp and a frame number, along with columns for
each of the time series you ask it to output. All of the columns except frame
number (it's an integer) are fixed point floats with 6 digits after the
decimal regardless of the measurement. So the time stamp is given to
microsecond precision. If you record data through the mocap module in D-Flow it
should respect Cortex's 100 hz sample rate, but the period between time stamps
hovers around one hundredth of a second. The following plot shows the variation
in period between samples (which also has an interesting pattern):

I've never dealt with a data acquisition system (yet alone a half a million
dollar one) that gives you fishy results like this. And this doesn't even
mention the fact that if you use D-Flow's record module you get really huge
variability in the sample rate because it is tied to D-Flow's computations which
include 3D graphical rendering at each time step. This may be fine and dandy
for clinicians but for researchers I'd expect more control and precision in the
output data. This tied with the fact that they write missing values as 0.000000
instead of an identifier like NA or Nan is really annoying for data
processing. I think any good DAQ should provide you with data in this form::

  data array = [1.2e-16, 1.3e-16, 1.4e-16, NA, 1.5e-16, 1.6e-16, NA, 1.7e-16]
  sample rate = 100 # hz

Then there is no ambiguity in the data that you have. You know the fixed
period, the data values are floating point, and missing values have a clear
indicator. There should also be some reported accuracy of the measured values.

Human Body Model
================

Ton sent me his C code for the Human Body Model, which I'm going to work on
wrapping with both Matlab and Python so that we can use it in data processing
without being tied to D-Flow and running it real time. It should be relatively
simple to wrap the code.

2D Walking Model
================

Ton also sent me a 2D walking model which has a foot contact model that we can
use to test out controllers on. He presented it in a tutorial and the dynamic
walking conference in 2011 and the software can be downloaded here:

It also looks like Open Sim has some simple 2D models that we can test out.
Chris is helping me get familiar with OpenSim. The OpenSim models are here:

Opensim has also moved their repo to github so hopefully contributions will
ramp up like other projects that move to git and github:
