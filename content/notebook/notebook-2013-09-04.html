hmc.csuohio.edu
===============

Finally got in touch with Tommie Barclay about mapping hmc.csuohio.edu to our
IP address: 54.221.204.249. She's going to get back to me next week about it.

Walking System Identification
=============================

I made good progress today squashing bugs in my walking system identification
code. The results of using the methods and software are here:

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/moorepants/walking-sys-id/5f88812eba5b5bbf26153f3fca83d122b2135073/src/control_solver_example.ipynb

I can compute the optimal linear gains at specified instances along the gait
cycle for an arbitrary data set.

The library for the code is in:

https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit

And the notebooks explaining things are now stored here:

https://github.com/moorepants/walking-sys-id

The next things to add are:

1. Add an option to use a sparse matrix data type for the A matrix and the
   sparse least squares solvers for them.
2. Output the variance of the fit and the covariance of the parameters,
   including plots.
3. Make plots of the resulting plant inputs from the controller and compare
   them to the "measured" inputs.
