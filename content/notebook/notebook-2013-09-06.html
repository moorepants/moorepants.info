Walking System Identification
=============================

The walking control identification is is pretty good shape now. At this point
we need to try it on more data that includes perturbations. I've written a
couple of classes with pretty good unit test coverage that handle managing
walking data and identifying the gains in a simple control scheme for walking
which can be found here:

https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit/blob/master/dtk/walk.py

The maths and problem framework that guided the above code are explained here:

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/moorepants/walking-sys-id/master/src/walking_least_squares.ipynb

I use it to analyze a couple of data sets, one from Ton and one from Obinna, of
normal unperturbed walking. The basic results are presented here:

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/moorepants/walking-sys-id/29312d6b6230576cb303033384205acb6a8381da/src/control_solver_example.ipynb

I believe the method works computationally and is giving correct results for
the given data. I haven't spent much time thinking about the usefulness of the
current results yet. The two walkers give very different looking gains.

So now we are ready to try it on some perturbed data and I'm also planning to
see if the identified controller(s) can make a simple walking model walk. I'll
soon add how well the controller can predict data that wasn't used for the
identification.

I'm soliciting comments on what kinds of graphs are useful, how to present the
data, if this is a reasonable method, or anything else, please let em rip.
