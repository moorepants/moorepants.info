System Identification
=====================

I've been using sys id for a long time now and learnt it on my own for my
dissertation work, but I've hit enough walls in just being a user that I really
need to start understanding what the hell is going on. I like Ljung's book
"System Identification: Theory for the User", but it think the title would
better be "System Identification: Theory for the Theorist" because he doesn't
show you how to actually implement things computationally, which is what a
"user" really needs. So I'm going to work through his book from page one and
come up with the computations for the main methods in a series of IPython
notebooks. I hope that my knowledge will then be sufficient to design a general
system id package in Python and actually be readable (unlike the system id
toolbox in Matlab).

The repo is at:

https://github.com/moorepants/ljung1999

And the computations for Chapter 1 have been started here:

Walking System Identification
=============================

Over the weekend I implemented a method to zero out the identification of
particular gains in the gain matrix (closing issue
https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit/issues/5).

The results are here for the example data:

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/moorepants/walking-sys-id/cfc1143c684ce0e6d1cc4daed0d96f3bc6a5f3d5/src/control_solver_example.ipynb

I'm not sure why the sum of the residuals is being returned as zero from
numpu.linalg.lstsq. It seems like the A matrix becomes rank deficient once I
delete columns which correspond to different feedback loops. It also seems like
the gains that I don't zero out have similar profiles to the previous full gain
matrix calculations.

I also found some bugs and spent a long time working on it today. Will report
more tomorrow.

PYCON 2014
==========

I submitted a PyDy tutorial and a python for human walking data analysis for
PyCon 2014 in Montreal. We'll see what happens...
