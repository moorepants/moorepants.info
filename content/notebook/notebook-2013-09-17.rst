Butterworth Filters
===================

Sandy noticed that Luuk may not have been setting the crossover frequency
correctly in his report. In the Matlab style digital Butterworth filter design
you typically set the wn argument to::

  desired filter cutoff frequency
  nyquist frequency of the signal

This is a normalized cutoff frequency. Our system samples at 100 hz max due to
the motion capture data limits. You can pull in data at higher sample rates but
then you get repeated values for the mocap signals.

I wrote this little script to show what happens if you select a nyquist
frequency other than the actual sample rate of the signal you want to filter:

The resulting plot is:

   :class: img-rounded
   :width: 400px
   :target: https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/moorepants/butterworth-nyquist.png

If you choose a larger Nyquist frequency than the signal, then you push the
passband frequency to a lower value. Luuk may have done this incorrectly in his
report.

CITI Test
=========

Woohoo, finished the IRB and ethical research tests. They were long but
informative. Some seemed really outdated. I posted some details to my G+
account about passages that I thought weren't true.

Plone Bibliography Support
==========================

Three options that I'm looking into:

1. Install Products.CMFBibliographyAT and users can create bibliography folders
   and manually add items.
2. Create a custom content type that pulls in HTML from a public Zotero group
   and displays it.
3. Create a button on the TinyMCE editor which, when clicked, prompts the user
   for a public zotero group and collection id, and embeds the content from the
   resulting zotero api call into the page.

I could setup some super simple pages that display stuff served up by pyzotero
on our server outside of plone, and them iframe it into a plone page. But that
wouldn't have styling and would probably suck.

Zotero gives atom and xhtml standard api calls:

http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/server_api/v2/read_requests#example_requests_and_responses

The atom feed can be read in any feed reader (i.e. a Plone portlet).

If I need to do the zotero api calls from Python in Plone there is this lib:

Here is an API call to a public Zotero group I set up:

https://api.zotero.org/groups/212385/collections/JWGBWM9P/items?format=bib

It sends back some simple xhtml.

How to add plugins to TinyMCE:

Plone products that have TinyMce plugins:
