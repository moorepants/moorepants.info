hmc.csuohio.edu
===============

Ms. Barclay finally routed hmc.csuohio.edu to our IP address on AWS. A quick
change to the nginx config made use live.

GSoC
====

Most of Tarun's PRs are ready to be merged. We'll have a working package by the
end of the week. The only thing major that is left is the tutorial(s) in the
Sphinx docs.

NSF Grant
=========

Ton, Dan, and Hanz found out they got a $1.5M NSF grant for prostheses design.
Impressive! I hope we get another post doc in our lab.
