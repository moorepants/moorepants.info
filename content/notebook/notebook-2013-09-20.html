Google Calendar RSS Feeds
=========================

I use this feed for the rss portlet in plone:

https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/username/basic?futureevents=true&orderby=starttime&sortorder=ascending&singleevents=true

The parameters show the latest upcoming events, but Plone rss feed portlet
displays the date of create of the event instead of the start time of the
event, which I need to figure out. Might need to be a custom portlet that
copies the RSS portlet, but changes the displayed date.

Sample Size Determination
=========================

Obinna has a model that computes joint angles given accelerometer data. Ton has
a model that computes joint angles given marker data. We believe the marker
data model is pretty accurate, but the joint angles from accelerometers is a new
idea. Obinna would like to know how many samples (subjects, speeds, cadences,
of walking) are needed to ensure that his model is equivalent to Ton's model.

Obinna picks some statistics like peak joint angles in a gait cycle and
computes them with both methods. If he plots the peak joint angle computed from
each trial with joint angle on both the x an y axes and where the x axes is the
joint angle computed from Ton's method and the y axes computed from Obinna's
model then you'd expect to see a line form with slope = 1 and y-intercept = 0.

y = m x + b

y = obinna's output
x = ton's output

\hat{m} and \hat{b} are the estiamted slope and intercept given the actual
data.

Thus we'd like to make some hypotheses.

H_0 (null hypothesis): m_o = m_t and b_o = b_t
H_1 (alternative hypothesis): m_o \neq m_t and b_o \neq b_t

If null hyptothesis is rejected when it is acutally true:

\alpha = P(type I error) = P(reject H_o|H_0 is true)

and if the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is false then

\beta = P(type II error) = P(fail to reject H_0|H_0 is false)

power is often talked about instead of \beta:

Power = 1 - \beta = P(reject H_0|H_0 is false)

If we had only one variable in the hypotheses we could compute the power for a
t-test and try to estimate sample size there.

For example the R pwr package gives::

  > pwr.t.test(d=0.8, sig.level=.05, power=.95)

       Two-sample t test power calculation 

                n = 41.59414
                d = 0.8
        sig.level = 0.05
            power = 0.95
      alternative = two.sided

   NOTE: n is number in *each* group

where d is set for large effects (Cohen recommends 0.8).

On page 275 of Discovering Statistics using R, Field 2012 the authors show a
plot of sample size as a function of predictors in the regression equation for
different effect sizes. For 2 predictors and large effect, it recommends at
least 40 samples. This graph comes form Miles and Shelvin 2001. But in the
preceding text he gives two rules of thumb from Green 1991:

50 + 8k if you only want to test only the overall fit of your regression

and

104 + k if you want to test the individual predictors

For 2 predictors we need then either 66 or 106 samples.
