Walking System Identification
=============================

Over the weekend I setup the `SimpleControlSolver`_ to validate the identified
model against different data than that used for the identification. Right now
if you pass in a data set it will use the first half of the steps for
identification and the second half for validation. You can also pass in a
separate data set for the validation data if desired. The `latest version of
the control solver example`_ shows the results.

The picture hasn't gotten a whole lot clearer, but here are some observations:

- There are no apparent patterns in the gains as a function of percent of gait
  cycle. In a few of the gains there may be less activity in the swing phase,
  but it isn't clear.
- The variance in the identified gains with respect to the fit seem to be quite
  large. This may imply that the cost function has a large flat bottom where a
  variety of gain combinations will give pretty good fits.
- The VAF for the validations range between 45% and 80% for the different
  controls. The hip moments are better identified than the knee moments. And on
  average 10-20 Nm is error.
- The control contribution plots show that there is a nominal moment generated
  and the controller compensates for the remaining error in the sensors.
- The line charts for the control contribution plots which show the mean
  controls and give some idea in how much compensation is needed at each time
  step in the gait cycle. I'm not sure if this give much insight.
- Very oddly, the VAF is better if we use a "diagonal" gain matrix for the same
  data set. I have a hard time believing that is correct. There still isn't any
  apparent pattern in the gains either.
- The second data set gives similar results to the first in terms of gain
  magnitudes and VAF.
- There is one wild gain at about 60% in the model from the second data set.
