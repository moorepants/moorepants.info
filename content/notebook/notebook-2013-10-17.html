Gyrobike model
==============

I built linear and non-linear models of an extended Whipple model which
includes an additional flywheel mounted concentricly with the front wheel. This
was already done in my dissertation, but I converted the models to Matlab for
the senior design group to remove the requirement to learn a new language and
match up with what they are learning in their controls course. The models are
available here:

Opensim/Simbody
===============

Some notes to install on Ubuntu 13.04 from
7e06039b0aa4188d2ae63dd5ba36304cb6af467e.

Simbody

Here is some step by step instructions for installing on Ubuntu 12.04. I'm not
sure which version of the software is was:

http://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8080/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5114489

These requirements are already installed in the software dev and blas/lapack
sections::

   $ sudo aptitude install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui

This will get all the headers for the BLAS/LAPACK versions that are available::

   $ sudo aptitude install libblas-dev libatlas-dev libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev

Visualizer requires::

   $ sudo aptitude install freeglut3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev

::
   $ mkdir ~/src/simbody
   $ cd ~/src/simbody
   $ git clone git@github.com:simbody/simbody.git
   $ mkdir build
   $ mkdir build_d
   $ cd build
   $ ccmake ../simbody

In ccmake type 'c' for configure, 't' to toggle to advanced mode, edit any
values, 'c' again for configure, and 'g' for generate.

::

   $ cd ../build_d
   $ ccmake ../simbody

In ccmake change `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Debug`.

::
   $ make -j2 # -j2 specifies the number of cores you have
   $ make test
   $ ./ExamplePendulum # should show visualization
   $ make doxygen

The following puts everything in /usr/local, but it should have went into
/usr/local/SimTK. See https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/47 for more
info.

::

   $ sudo make install
   $ cd ../build
   $ make -j2
   $ make test
   $ sudo make install

Now try out using the libraries from an arbitrary directory. First, copy the
raw C++ files for the examples to a new directory to play with::

   $ cp -r ~/src/simbody/simbody/Simbody/examples ~/src/simbody-examples
   $ cd ~/src/simbody-examples
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/
   $ export SIMBODY_HOME=/usr/local

Comment out this line in the Makefile because I'm on a 64 bit system::

   M32FLAG = -m32

I also changed this line to::

   SimTK_HOME=/usr/local

to reflect where my libs were actually installed. Now try running the example::

   $ make ExamplePendulum
   $ ./ExamplePendulum

The gui should pop up. You can build all examples with::

   $ make all

I've read that having to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH should only be used for
testing. You shouldn't have to do this for standard installs. So I think the
Simbody devs should fix this. Also the compiled examples can't find the
/usr/local/bin directory unless I set SIMBODY_HOME. Otherwise it looks in
/usr/local/SimTK/bin which doesn't exist. When I originally ran ccmake it
didn't give me an option to set the installation directory and the default
seems to have been /usr/local instead of /usr/local/SimTK.

I need to uninstall and go into the advanced toggle in ccmake and set
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to `/usr/local/SimTK` and then reinstall.

I filed these issues:

- https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/48
- https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/47
- https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/46

OpenSim

::

   mkdir ~/src/opensim
   cd ~/src/opensim
   $ svn checkout https://simtk.org/svn/opensim/Trunk
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ccmake ../Trunk

Type 'c' and add::

   SimTK_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local

Type 'c' and then 'g'.

::

   $ make test

These tests failed on the trunk::

   32/51 Test #32: testOptimizationExampleRuns ..................***Timeout 1500.03 sec
         Start 33: testOptimizationExample
   33/51 Test #33: testOptimizationExample ......................***Failed    0.28 sec

These instructions are here:

https://github.com/moorepants/bin/blob/master/ubuntu_setup.rst

and will be updated as I work out the kinks.
