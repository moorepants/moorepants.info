Gyrobike model
==============

I built linear and non-linear models of an extended Whipple model which
includes an additional flywheel mounted concentricly with the front wheel. This
was already done in my dissertation, but I converted the models to Matlab for
the senior design group to remove the requirement to learn a new language and
match up with what they are learning in their controls course. The models are
available here:

Opensim/Simbody
===============

Some notes to install on Ubuntu 13.04 from
7e06039b0aa4188d2ae63dd5ba36304cb6af467e.

Simbody
-------

Here is some step by step instructions for installing on Ubuntu 12.04. I'm not
sure which version of the software is was:

http://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8080/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5114489

These requirements are already installed in the software dev and blas/lapack
sections::

   $ sudo aptitude install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui

This will get all the headers for the BLAS/LAPACK versions that are available::

   $ sudo aptitude install libblas-dev libatlas-dev libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev

Visualizer requires::

   $ sudo aptitude install freeglut3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev

::
   $ mkdir ~/src/simbody
   $ cd ~/src/simbody
   $ git clone git@github.com:simbody/simbody.git
   $ mkdir build
   $ mkdir build_d
   $ cd build
   $ ccmake ../simbody

In ccmake type 'c' for configure, 't' to toggle to advanced mode, edit any
values, 'c' again for configure, and 'g' for generate.

::

   $ cd ../build_d
   $ ccmake ../simbody

In ccmake change `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Debug`.

::
   $ make -j2 # -j2 specifies the number of cores you have
   $ make test
   $ ./ExamplePendulum # should show visualization
   $ make doxygen

The following puts everything in /usr/local, but it should have went into
/usr/local/SimTK. See https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/47 for more
info.

::

   $ sudo make install
   $ cd ../build
   $ make -j2
   $ make test
   $ sudo make install

Now try out using the libraries from an arbitrary directory. First, copy the
raw C++ files for the examples to a new directory to play with::

   $ cp -r ~/src/simbody/simbody/Simbody/examples ~/src/simbody-examples
   $ cd ~/src/simbody-examples
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/
   $ export SIMBODY_HOME=/usr/local

Comment out this line in the Makefile because I'm on a 64 bit system::

   M32FLAG = -m32

I also changed this line to::

   SimTK_HOME=/usr/local

to reflect where my libs were actually installed. Now try running the example::

   $ make ExamplePendulum
   $ ./ExamplePendulum

The gui should pop up. You can build all examples with::

   $ make all

I've read that having to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH should only be used for
testing. You shouldn't have to do this for standard installs. So I think the
Simbody devs should fix this. Also the compiled examples can't find the
/usr/local/bin directory unless I set SIMBODY_HOME. Otherwise it looks in
/usr/local/SimTK/bin which doesn't exist. When I originally ran ccmake it
didn't give me an option to set the installation directory and the default
seems to have been /usr/local instead of /usr/local/SimTK.

I need to uninstall and go into the advanced toggle in ccmake and set
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to `/usr/local/SimTK` and then reinstall.

I filed these issues:

- https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/48
- https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/47
- https://github.com/simbody/simbody/issues/46

OpenSim
-------

::

   mkdir ~/src/opensim
   cd ~/src/opensim
   $ svn checkout https://simtk.org/svn/opensim/Trunk
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ccmake ../Trunk

Type 'c' and add::

   SimTK_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local

Type 'c' and then 'g'.

::

   $ make test

These tests failed on the trunk::

   32/51 Test #32: testOptimizationExampleRuns ..................***Timeout 1500.03 sec
         Start 33: testOptimizationExample
   33/51 Test #33: testOptimizationExample ......................***Failed    0.28 sec

These instructions are here:

https://github.com/moorepants/bin/blob/master/ubuntu_setup.rst

and will be updated as I work out the kinks.
