Top priorities

- HMC research project and resulting papers, conferences, etc
- Publishing my personal research (that which may or may not be related to what
  we do in the HMC lab).
- Submit funding proposals

Secondary

- PyDy development, including GSoC mentoring/organizing
- Applying for long term jobs, mostly tenure track academic positions.
- Gyrobike senior design mentoring
- Lab meetings, seminars

Starting with 40 hrs a week:

- 20: hmc research project, this means planning and performing experiments,
  doing the analyses and/or study needed to do the analysys, reading papers,
  writing papers, etc
- 15: work on my research projects/papers, mostly trying to publish the work I
  did for my dissertation to increase my pub counts.
- 1: write and submit funding proposals (right now this amounts to the PyDy
  idea)

The remaining 14 hrs a week:

- 2.5 hrs: Lab meetings, seminars
- 1.5 hr: gyrobike meeting and help
- 6 hrs: everything else (pydy, job search)

If I look at the 37 weeks in my time tracker from July 8 2013 to March 22 2014,
I can try to figure out what I've spent my time on. There are 259 days, divided
by 7, is 37 weeks.

HMC project::

  400.5 (analysese ,etc)
  + 55.3 (MASB)
  + 46.7 (gait2d model)
  + 20.4 (treadmill repair)
  + 23.7 (control experiments)
  + 3.9 (WCB2014)
  + 2.2 (DW2014)
  552.7 hrs ~ 15 hr/week

My research:

  138.8 (bmd2013)
  + 49.2 (yeadon)
  + 15.8 (structural id)
  + 1.2 (bicycle params)
  + 0.5 (bicycle stuff)
  205.5 hrs ~ 6 hrs/week

Funding proposals::

  26.3 (opensim summer thing)
  1 hr/week

lab meetings + seminars::

  47.5 (lab meetings)
  + 7 (seminar)
  54.5 hrs ~ 1.5 hrs/week

gyrobike::

  34.6
  ~ 1 hr week

software dev::

  113 (pydy)
  + 8 (dtk)
  + 62.4 (sympy)
  183.4 hrs ~ 5 hrs/week

other::

  77 hrs (pycon/masb/scipy tutorial)
  2 hr/week

All this amounts to about 31.5 hours a week.

other:

~1509 total work hours - 1097.0 (all the other stuff) = 412.4 hrs ~ 11 hrs/week

So I'm spending way too much time doing a ton of other random stuff that isn't
contributing directly to my primary goals. So if I can redirect 18 hrs/week to
the primary goals that would be ideal. Maybe 10 more is realistic if I'm
disciplined.

1509 over 37 weeks is about 41 hr/wk (I didn't subtract vacation time or holidays
here so this is an underestimate.) I had 23 officials days off and there are
185 weekdays during the period. So 1509 hours over 162 days of work is 9.3
hrs/day (~47 hrs/week).

So a new schedule idea::

  Monday
  8 - hmc research

  Tuesday
  6 - hmc research
  1.5 - gyrobike

  Wednesday
  4 - hmc research
  3 - my research
  1 - lab meeting

  Thursday
  2 - hmc research
  1.5 - seminar
  4 - my research

  Friday
  8 - my research

  Saturday
  1-5 - other and/or catch up

  Sunday
  1-5 - other and/or catch up

Weekdays beyond 8 hours will be the other junk. This makes for a 41 to 49 hr
work week, basically.

| 20 hrs: HMC research
| 15 hrs: my research
| 4 hrs: meetings
| 2-10 hrs: other
|

The hard part will not be doing all the random crap and saying no to everyone
that walks into the door wanting something.
