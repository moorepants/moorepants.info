Some thoughts on system identification of planar walking control with direct
collocation.

{%- endmark %}


The system's equations:

.. math::

  -gm_t - m_t\dot{v}_t - F_c + F_p = 0

  -c\Delta y - gm_f - k\Delta y - m_f\dot{v}_f - F_a - F_o + F_c = 0

  c\Delta y - gm_s + k\Delta y - m_s\dot{v}_s + F_a + F_o = 0

Now thinking about the second equation we can measure, or estimate reasonably
well, these quantities: :math:`\Delta y, g, m_f, \dot{v}_f, F_c`. So inverse
dynamics says we can solve for :math:`F` given our measurements:

Second order Equations of motion for open loop planar walker:

.. math::

   0 = F_r + F_r^*

   0 = f(x(t)) + u(t) + w(t)

:math:`u(t)` are the joint torques
:math:`x(t)` are the states: joint angles and rates (9 joint DoFs + 3 DoFs for
global location and orientation)

:math:`w(t)` is the external input which should be a force that corresponds to
the random longitudinal change in belt velocity. This will need to be modeled
as a specified speed input so the measured belt speed velocity can be used
directly.

We also can have some output equations that spit out marker location and ground
reaction forces (these are the things we actually measure).

.. math::

   y = g(x(t))

We then assume a controller of the form:

.. math::

   u(t) = m^*(\varphi) - K(\varphi) x(t)

:math:`\varphi` is the proportion of the gait cycle time (percent heel strike
to heel strike)

This then creates our closed loop system:

.. math::

   0 = f(x(t)) + m^*(\varphi) - K(\varphi) x(t) + w(t)

Then we discretize :math:`x(t)`, :math:`u(t)`, and :math:`w(t)`. At any instant
in time the equations of motion must be true.

Question, how will :math:`\varphi` be known during any given interation of the
solver. Will heel strikes have to be determined for each interation? Or is that
something that comes from the data, i.e. :math:`\varphi` is fixed (i.e. for a
given time :math:`t` in the data recording, :math:`\varphi` can be computed).

The cost function will be designed to minimize energy (sum of square of joint
torques) and to minimize the difference in measured ground reaction forces and
the marker positions.

The free parameters (unknowns) in the optimization problem will be the
discretized states, the discretized :math:`w(t)` input, and the controller
parameters.

There are 12 markers with two coordinates each, 4 ground reaction forces, 2
ground reaction moments, and one measured belt speed. We measure each of these
at 100 hz over 8 minutes for each trial. So 48000 samples.

The closed loop model has 9 DoF, 18 states, and 1 input.
