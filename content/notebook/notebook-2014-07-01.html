Ipopt installation
==================

I tried to install from the Ubuntu repos, but had trouble linking to it or
running the example::

   $ sudo aptitude install coinor-libipopt1 coinor-libipopt-dev coinor-libipopt-doc

So then I removed it::

   $ sudo aptitude remove coinor-libipopt1 coinor-libipopt-dev coinor-libipopt-doc

The Ipopt documentation_ gives very nice instructions for installing it from
source, which basically goes like this::

   $ cd ~/src
   $ svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Ipopt/stable/3.11 CoinIpopt
   $ cd CoinIpopt/ThirdParty/Blas
   $ ./get.Blas
   $ cd ../Lapack
   $ ./get.Lapack
   $ cd ../ASL
   $ ./get.ASL
   $ cd ../Mumps
   $ ./get.Mumps
   $ cd ../Metis
   $ ./get.Metis

This downloads the BLAS and LAPACK reference implementations, but I think the
compilation process looks in the system for the system installed
implementations and uses them if you have them.

It is a good idea to get the HSL code (but not necessarily required because
Mumps can be used) and drop it in the ThirdParty/HSL directory. You have to get
the free academic license 2011 code and sign a form to use it. It also takes a
day to get the download link by email. (Note that this can be linked as a
shared lib after compiling ipopt, so recompiling is required, but it may be
easier to just recompile).

I compiled without HSL because I'm waiting for the download link.

First change into the build directory::

   $ cd ../../build

And run configure::

   $ ./configure

These are some potential options I may want to set in the future::

   --prefix /usr/local  # for system install
   --with-blas="-L$HOME/lib -lmyblas"  # link to better blas implementations

Now compile, test, and install::

   $ make -j5
   $ make test
   $ make install  # sudo if system install

This ended up putting everything in ``~/src/CoinIpopt/`` like
``~/src/CoinIpopt/include``, ``~/src/CoinIpopt/lib``, etc. So I did something
wrong, as I thought it should have ended up in ``~src/CoinIpopt/build/``.

cyipopt
=======

I'm hoping to use Ipopt through a Python wrapper. Seems like there are two
existing standalone wrappers pyipopt_ and cyipopt_. I like cython and cyipopt
was newer, so I gave it a shot.

I first created a conda Python 2.7 environment::

   $ conda create -n cyipopt numpy scipy cython matplotlib sphinx
   $ source activate cyipopt

Then got the source code from bitbucket::

    $ cd ~/src
    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/amitibo/cyipopt
    $ cd cyipopt

I installed on Ubuntu 14.04 so I had to do some pruning in the setup.py file.
Basically just remove some odd stuff from ``main_unix()`` so it looks like
this::

   def main_unix():

       setup(
           name=PACKAGE_NAME,
           version=VERSION,
           description=DESCRIPTION,
           author=AUTHOR,
           author_email=EMAIL,
           url=URL,
           packages=[PACKAGE_NAME],
           cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext},
           ext_modules=[
               Extension(
                   PACKAGE_NAME + '.' + 'cyipopt',
                   ['src/cyipopt.pyx'],
                   **pkgconfig('ipopt')
               )
           ],
       )

Since I didn't install IPopt system wide I needed to export these two
environment variables to get things to work::

   $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:~/src/CoinIpopt/lib/pkgconfig
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/src/CoinIpopt/lib

And finally::

   $ python setup.py install
   $ python test/examplehs071.py
   $ python test/lasso.py

And it worked.

Other Things
============

Here are a bunch of other notes about things I found today:

- A list of Python optimization tools: https://software.sandia.gov/trac/coopr/wiki/Documentation/RelatedProjects
- Casadi is a symbolic framework for numerica optimization with automatic
differentiation, has python bindings and includes Ipopt: https://github.com/casadi/casadi/
- NLOPT: has a bunch of optimizers plus python bindings: http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt
- Most all of the large scale NLP optimizers seem to be guarded behind close
  source licenses.
- pagmo: parallel optimization includes python bindings and has SciPy, SNOPT,
  and IPOPT connections https://github.com/esa/pagmo
- nlpy: large scale optimization with python https://github.com/dpo/nlpy
- Nice SO question on NLP in Python: http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/83/is-there-a-high-quality-nonlinear-programming-solver-for-python
- The paper that explains SNOPT's algorithm: http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/SOL/reports/snopt.pdf
- JSModelica seems to have some Pyton interfaces to things.
- PyOpt interfaces lots of code, but mostly commercial code.
- OpenMDAO uses PyOpt.
- My old labmate Gilbert has a Python Optimal Control package
  https://github.com/gilbertgede/PyOCP and an interior point optimizer
  https://github.com/gilbertgede/PyIntropt
