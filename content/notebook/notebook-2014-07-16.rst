NCSRR 5 week plan.



NCSRR Biweekly Plan
===================

Started on Monday July 14

Thursday Jul 17

- Prepare and give kickoff talk
- Setup latest Opensim/Simbody dev environment
- Read some papers to get an idea of scale limits in NLP problems with IPOPT
  and/or SNOPT
- Complete all the orientation stuff for Stanford
- Complete initial test run of inverted pendulum on cart problem with 10,000
  nodes in IPOPT
- Talk with Jack Wang about using his existing code (if I can use the code, below
  plans may be altered)
- Discuss direct collocation vs shooting with Ton and others

Monday Jul 21

- Test the limits of scaling in the inverted pendulum code, make computational
  speed improvements.
- Build (or obtain) a basic torque driven 9/10 DoF model in Opensim

Thursday Jul 24

- Implement gain scheduled black box control structure for the planar walking
  model in Opensim

Monday Jul 28

- Start development of direct collocation code in C++ (port stuff from my
  current Python code) using numerical functionality from Simbody

Thursday Jul 31

- Complete initial direct collocation implementation

Monday Aug 4

- Iterate on direct collocation solutions: testing initial guesses, minimal
  data sets, # discretization nodes, improve computational speed, etc.
- Implement IPOPT + paradiso on an AWS instance

Thursday Aug 7

- Either polish things that work or fix things that don't.

Monday Aug 11

- Either polish things more that work or fix things that don't.

Thursday Aug 14

- Prepare and present results and findings
