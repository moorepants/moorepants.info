AOI for July 25 to July 30

A
=

- The n-link inverted pendulum on a cart system id with direct collocation now
  works. Preliminary tests show that up to 24 gains on a 3 link pendulum can be
  identified from noisy data using 50-100 hz discretization sampling and up to
  10000 collocation nodes.
- Further developed an opensim planar walking model to match my custom walking
  model.
- Mentored GSoC students: reviewed PRs and IRC/email discussions.
- Started the implementation of a System class in PyDy with Chris.
- Worked on planning for a Software Carpentry Bootcamp in Cleveland.
- Dealt with migration of a Plone lab website at UC Davis.
- Finished PLoS One review.
- Learned how to use starcluster.

O
=

- Run extensive tests on the inverted pendulum system id system and summarize
  the method's abilities to identify the controller for a variety of # of
  degrees of freedom, initial guesses, measurement noise, discretization
  intervals and simulation durations. The idea is to make sure that the scale
  of the gait control id problem can be solved.
- Figure out how to get Pardiso compiled with IPOPT.
- Discuss direct collocation implementation in Opensim with Ajay and start
  writing and porting code to C++.
- Read and understand Jack and Tim's code base.
- Design gain scheduled feedback controller in Opensim to match our direct ID
  control model.
- Work on research statement for prof applications.

I
=

- Took longer than expected to get the direct collocation system id problem
  working.
- Got sunburned in the Mokelumne Wilderness.
