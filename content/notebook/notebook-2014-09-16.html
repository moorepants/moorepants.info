Last week's accomplishments
===========================

Objectives from last week

I spent 12.2 hours on the steer torque paper work instead of the 9.5 I
projected.

- [3 hours] Finish table in the steer torque paper. Update the spreadsheet and
  insert into the latex doc. -- Done:
  https://github.com/moorepants/steer-torque-manuscript/commit/24b2d4419cf5d052706c944a12f54fbc91eea9be,
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XDN2wXa7abgd_W1jIejA62ITD0qSIUIqmqNJnC0qpbQ/pubhtml
- [2 hours] Add in torque wrench section into the steer torque paper. -- Done:
  https://github.com/moorepants/steer-torque-manuscript
- [0.5 hour] Make a figshare dataset for the torque wrench experiments csv
  file. -- Done: http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1167497
- [4 hours] Send Mont a first draft of the steer torque paper for review (by
  Saturday). -- Done:
  https://github.com/moorepants/steer-torque-manuscript/releases/tag/first-draft

I spent 3.6 hours on the bicycle data paper which was under the 4 I projected.
I didn't do very complete jobs of these tasks though.

- [1 hour] Write and introduction to the bicycle data paper. -- Done:
  https://github.com/moorepants/bicycle-data-paper
- [1 hour] Write a section about the raw data in the bicycle data paper. --
  Started: https://github.com/moorepants/bicycle-data-paper
- [2 hours] Add README's and any other needed data to the davis instrumented
  bicycle raw data sets and make public. -- 80% done: created an rst file with
  the trial data info, need to add calibration data info.

Planning took 5 hours instead of 4.5, but I also spent 3.4 hours giving the
tutorial and following up with a recap.

- [4 hours] Prepare materials for the IEEE open source night (by Friday). --
  Done: https://github.com/moorepants/intro-to-open-source and
  https://github.com/moorepants/ieee-tic-tac-toe.
- [0.5 hour] Send out installation instructions for IEEE open source night (by
  Thursday). -- Done: see https://github.com/moorepants/intro-to-open-source
  for installation instructions.

This only took 0.6 hrs instead of 2.

- [2 hours] Pick a talk topic for the seminar and draft an outline of the talk.
  -- Done: https://github.com/moorepants/csu-fall-hmc-seminar

I spent 1.8 hrs on writing, a bit over 1.

- [1 hour] Write system description section in the inverted pendulum paper. --
  Done: see https://github.com/csu-hmc/inverted-pendulum-sys-id-paper

I spent 8.4 hours writing this code and instead of 5.

- [5 hours] Implement a ufuncify for vectorized matrix evaluations for the
  inverted pendulum direct id code. The compile times currently are prohibitive
  for more than two links. -- Done:
  https://github.com/csu-hmc/inverted-pendulum-sys-id/commit/000f2c7c860627c8ab4e24816fb13820c2fe16bc

This took 1.5 hours instead of 1.

- [1 hour] Write meta data description in perturbed walking data paper. --
  Done: https://github.com/csu-hmc/perturbed-data-paper/commit/2b87b4867318d966afd34993476bc0c294f6c8fb

It looks like I spent 33.1 hours on an estimated 27.0 hours of work, so I
underestimated by about 18% of the actual time. The more interesting thing is
that I worked 14.7 more hours on things that were not on the objectives list.
So I spent an extra 45% of the actual objectives time doing other stuff.

Other things I did

- Github: 35 commits, 3 merged pull requests, 11 issues added.
- [3.4 hours] Led a tutorial for ~30 students on collaborative software development and
  open source and wrote a recap at https://github.com/moorepants/intro-to-open-source/issues/1.
- Got myself into a bet with Dr. Rashidi about what makes a rattleback reverse.
- Discussed Ton's and my idea about a direct collocation tool with Luke to see
  if he wants to come out to work on it.

Last week's issues
==================

- [1 hour] Make a blog post explaining how I setup the Plone offsite backups.
  -- Ran out of time, will skip this unless I find myself with some time.
- [0.5 hour] Make sure that the hmc.csuohio.edu offsite backup can be restored.
  -- Ran out of time, will check this week.
- [0.5 hour] Try to upload the davis instrumented bicycle h5 file (with raw and
  processed data) to Figshare. -- Done, ran our of time, will do this week.
- [2 hours] Draft a plan/outline for a new research statement for prof
  applications. -- Too low on the priority list, will do this week.

This week's objectives
======================

I'm taking off Friday and will in Louisville for the weekend, so I'm probably
overestimating what I can do this week. The estimate is about ~23 hrs, so
according to last week it will take me ~27 hrs to to the work and I'll spend 11
more hours doing other stuff, putting me at ~38 hrs of actual work time.

Lab Stuff

- [0.5 hr] Make sure that the hmc.csuohio.edu offsite backup can be restored.
- [6 hr] Create a presentation for the lab seminar on the 17th.

Perturbed Walking Data Paper

- [1 hr] Write draft of data processing software section.

Parameter Identification with Direct Collocation Paper

- [1 hr] Add a section about how the direct collocation is implemented with a
  backward Euler integration assumption.

Parameter Identification with Direct Collocation Source Code

- [2 hr] Add the ability to specify constants and arrays explicitly in
  ufuncify_matrix to avoid creating arrays of constants in the jacobian
  evaluation function.
- [1 hr] Move the indice computation out of the jacobian evaluation
  computation.

Bicycle Data Paper

- [1 hr] Finish raw data README.
- [2 hr] Create calibration data README.
- [0.5 hr] Try to upload the davis instrumented bicycle h5 file (with raw and
  processed data) to Figshare.

Bicycle Steer Torque Paper

- [1 hr] Change R plots to a prettier ggplot2 version.
- [1 hr] Improve the matplotlib plots to make them prettier.
- [0.5 hr] Add in a good photo of the actual steer torque design to go along
  with the CAD model.
- [0.5 hr] Figure out the best citation for Kageyama's design.

Yeadon Paper

- [0.25 hr] Commit latest draft from the journal to Git.

Software Carpentry

- [1 hr] Respond to Nick Hermez.
- [1 hr] Decide on a date, confer with Ahmet, and let Software Carpentry know.
- [0.5 hr] Make a list of tasks that need to be done so I can divvy them up.

Job Search

- [2 hours] Draft a plan/outline for a new research statement for prof
  applications.
