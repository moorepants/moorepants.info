Last week's accomplishments
===========================

Inverted Pendulum Paper

- [1 hr, Done ~ 2 hr] Finish SymPy reserved words PR.

  - This fixed some issues related to computing the symbolic Jacobian of the
    walking model. (#8199_, #8200_)

- [5 hr, Done ~ 5 hr] Implement simulation with process noise, measurement
  noise (both on states and torques), and perturbation accelerations.

  - I've implemented the `Park 2004 model`_ and the parameter id for it, but it
    doesn't work fully yet. See the issues.

- [1 hr, Done 0.5 hr] Rework the outline to reflect Ton and my discussion.

  - Outline is in the README_.

- [0.25 hr, Done 0.1 hr] Email Samin to inquire about co-authorship.
- [1 hr, Done 1 hr] Decide on specific figures to include.

  - See the README_.

Walking Data Paper

- [1 hr, Done 2 hr] Describe the GaitAnalysisToolkit DFlow data and it's output.

  - See `latest pdf`_.

- [1 hr, Done 1 hr] Write a closing paragraph.

  - See the conclusion in the `latest pdf`_.

- [1 hr, Done 1 hr] Decide on what plots to show that display the nature of the data and
  add to the outline.
- [4 hr, Done 11 hr] Create the plots for the paper.

  - Two draft plots are created and can be seen in the `latest pdf`_. Also see
    this conversation_.

Bicycle Data Paper

- [2 hr] Write section describing the instrumentation.
- [2 hr] Write section describing the experiments.
- [1 hr] Decide on figures in the paper.

Done, 2.6 hr. See the `latest version`_.

Old website

Two people asked me for materials on my old website this past week which was
erased by the UCD IT deparment.

- [2 hr] Send ENG 4 teaching materials to Yuri.
- [2 hr] Setup my old website so the pedal desk students can access the
  information.

Done, 1 hr, website is up temporarily here: http://www.moorepants.info/jkm/

Other

- [3 hr] Cleaned up the GaitAnalysisToolKit_ to get it in shape for release and
  publication. Bunch of commits.

Last week's issues
==================

Inverted Pendulum Paper

- The Park 2004 identification.

  - When I use realistic human parameters I'm having a hard time getting
    convergence. See `issue 18`_.

- [5 hr] Finish implementing the Ackermann 2010 example.

  - I fixed all the issues related to computing the symbolic Jacobian but now I
    think I have an issue with the additional constraints for periodicity. I'm
    not sure, but IPOPT is balking with this error::

Bicycle Steer Torque Paper

Didn't get to this at all.

- [5 hr] Go over Mont's commments and fix them.
- [2 hr] Use seaborn to improve the matplotlib histogram plots.


This week's objectives
======================

- [7 hr] CSU Open Access Symposia
- [2 hr] Draft consulting agreement and send to Ton.
- Go on a bicycle ride through Phnom Phen.
- [5 hr] Go over Mont's commments on the steer torque paper and fix them.
- [2 hr] Use seaborn to improve the matplotlib histogram plots in the steer
  torque paper.

I'm not going to make any other objectives but will work on some stuff.
