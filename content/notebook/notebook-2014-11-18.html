{%- endmark %}


Last week's accomplishments
===========================

GaitAnalysisToolKit

- [3 hr, Done 2 hr] Show Sabrina how to install and assign her an issue.

Peturbed Walking Data Paper

- [0.5 hr, Done 0.5 hr] Merge Sandy's PR.

Website

- [2 hr, Done 1 hr] Go over server maintenance stuff with Sabrina.

Unplanned

- [2 hr] Dealt with time sheet issues and Kronos.
- [1.2 hr] Discussed Open Knee project with Ahmet.
- [1.8 hr] Learned about and how to use Docker.

Last week's issues
==================

I didn't do very well at completing many of the objectives last week. May be my
most unproductive week in a long while.

opty

- [4 hr, Almost done 15.6 hr] Implement trapezoidal rule integration and test
  on parameter id problems.

  - I gave up on the trapezoidal rule and other second order integrators
    because they don't fit the current model in opty very well. Higher order
    integrators can be implemented but it would take a bit more refactoring
    than desired. So I started implementing the midpoint rule and I'm goofing
    around with a bug that maps the indices of the symbolic partial derivatives
    to the triplet format for the sparse Jacobian of the constraint vector.

Other

- [3 hr, half way done 2.5 hr] Reveiw bicycle dynamics paper for VSD.

  - I've read most of the paper and written up the detail comments. I need to
    check a few things they presented and then write up an overall few
    paragraphs with my conclusions.

All of the below objectives from last week were neglected.

PyDy

- [3 hr] Make all generated Cython files go to a tmp directory.

Inverted Pendulum Paper

- [6 hr] Figure out why convergence is poor for the human parameter set.
- [3 hr] Setup the direct id approach for the Park model.
- [5 hr] Setup the shooting approach for the Park model.

Peturbed Walking Data Paper

- [0.5 hr] Fix the stride/step/gait cycle terminology.
- [3 hr] Create light boxplots instead of the histograms.
- [0.5 hr] Make an appendix with the long tables and other crud.

Steer Torque Paper

- [8 hr] Work on revision, fixing issues reported by Mont.

Other

- [2 hr] Write up consulting proposal and budget.
