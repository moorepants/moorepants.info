Last week's accomplishments
===========================

Perturbed Data Paper

- [18 hr, Closer to done 14 hr] Finish all remaining issues and prepare the
  draft for submission.

  - Picked a working title
  - Added in journal styles
  - Create participant and trial tables + source code
  - Add syntax highlighting lib
  - Got all exploratory code working with GATK 0.1.2
  - Found to bugs in GATK and made releases 0.1.1 and 0.1.2

Inverted Pendulum Paper

- [6 hr, Done 6.5 hr] Try out scaling methods and see if convergence improves.

  - I ended up scaling the parameters to be closer to 0.5 and the optimizer now
    converges nicely, in only ~13 iterations even for long measurement times.

Non-objectives

- [4.3 hr] Worked with Sabrina on the NAO and came to the conclusion that the
  methods needed to disable the collision protection were no longer available
  in the new version 2 of the API.
- [0.5 hr] Searched for more reviewers for the Yeadon paper.

updates, and five interviews. I took Friday off to deal with that.
