Last week(s)'s accomplishments
==============================

I didn't do an AIO for a while, so this is stuff since the last one.

Rando
-----

- Completed everything to be a SWC instructor and am now officially an
  instructor. I'm going to teach a workshop at UC Irvine in late February.
- Had a PyDy sprint last weekend with 7 people to get the website and
  documentation cleaned up and digestible for newcomers.
- Interviewed for an awesome robotics/machine learning job.

Yeadon Paper
------------

- Final review came in. The paper is accepted for indexing. We are going to
  submit a revision to address both reviewers' comments.

Perturbed Data Paper
--------------------

- [1 hr, Done 1.7] Create a web page on hmc.csuohio.edu for the paper.

  - Created a basic project page and added youtube hosted videos:
    http://hmc.csuohio.edu/projects/gait-control-id

- Reviews came in. The paper is accepted with minor revisions.

Gait Direct Identification Paper
--------------------------------

- [1 hr, Not done] Setup a repository
- [2 hr, Not done] Draft an outline

Quiet Standing Identification Paper
-----------------------------------

- [5 hr, Done (too many hours)] Work on the ODE eval speed up for the shooting
  implementation.
- [10 hr, Done] Write the code for running a single shooting method.
- Sped up the integration significantly. For example a 10 second integration
  with 5000 requested time points runs in about 1.5s. I had to write an
  efficient interpolation method in Cython and I also tweaked PyDy's code
  generation stuff to gain some speed ups. This makes the data generation and
  shooting less time consuming.
- All three methods now run: direct identification, indirect with direct
  collocation and shooting. For shooting, I can use any algorithm provided in
  scipy.optimize and additionally I have a parallelized CMAES implementation.
  Indirect with dc and CMAES can find a solution from an initial guess of zero
  for the gains. Other shooting algs are picky about the initial guess. DC is
  fast (5 s) and CMAES takes in the hour(s) ranges. Haven't gotten all the
  timings yet. SQLSP doesn't take long (several minutes) if you give it a
  pretty much perfect guess.
- Some work on the bias from direct and indirect has been done
  (https://github.com/csu-hmc/inverted-pendulum-sys-id-paper/issues/1). I just
  need to run the indirect methods so I can compare.
- I have a data generation routine setup that makes generating lots of data
  relatively easy.

Last week's issues
==================

- Still can't focus and get 40+ hrs of work done on research. I miss having to
  actually go to work.

This week's objectives
======================

Yeadon Paper
------------

- [30 min] Email authors to start the second revision process and open some new
  Github issues.

Perturbed Data Paper
--------------------

- [1 hr] Create issues in the repository for all the fixes.
- [30 min] Email co-authors with tasks and deadline.
- [2 hr] Write draft of response in the github repo.

Quiet Standing Identification Paper
-----------------------------------

- [6 hr] Finish direct/indirection bias comparison plot.
- [5 hr] Finish computation speed results.
- [5 hr] Make a gain accuracy vs duration of simulation plot.
- [5 hr ] Try a set of initial conditions with each method and compare which ones
  converge and which don't.

Gait Control Direct ID Paper
----------------------------

- [1 hr, Not done] Setup a repository (convert the walking-sys-id repo and move
  to csu-hmc org.
- [2 hr, Not done] Draft an outline and what figures tables should be present.
