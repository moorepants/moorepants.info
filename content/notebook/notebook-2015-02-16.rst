AIO for February 16, 2015



Last week's accomplishments
===========================

Yeadon Paper

- [30 min, Done 30 min] Email authors to start the second revision process and
  open some new Github issues.

  - All issues are here: https://github.com/chrisdembia/python-yeadon-paper/issues

- [Additional, 1.3 hr] Fixed the syntax highlighting issue and helped Mont
  get setup to contribute on Github.
- [Additional, 0.4 hr] Fixed the pinned versions in the advanced example.

Perturbed Data Paper

- [1 hr, Done 0.8 hr] Create issues in the repository for all the fixes.

  - https://github.com/csu-hmc/perturbed-data-paper/issues

- [30 min, Done 0.5 hr] Email co-authors with tasks and deadline.
- [2 hr, Done 1.5 hr] Write draft of response in the github repo.

  - https://github.com/csu-hmc/perturbed-data-paper/pull/135

Quiet Standing Identification Paper

- [6 hr, Done 14.7 hr] Finish direct/indirection bias comparison plot.

  - https://github.com/csu-hmc/inverted-pendulum-sys-id-paper/issues/1

- [5 hr, Done 3.5 hr] Make a gain accuracy vs duration of simulation plot.

  - https://github.com/csu-hmc/inverted-pendulum-sys-id-paper/issues/2

- [Additional, 2.2 hr] Got the data generation working better.
- [Additional, 1.1 hr] Implemented threaded parallelization to the Jacobian
  evaluation. This has significant speed ups for Jacobians with large
  expressions. https://github.com/csu-hmc/opty/pull/28

Gait Control Direct ID Paper

- [1 hr, Done 0.2 hr] Setup a repository (convert the walking-sys-id repo and
  move to csu-hmc org.

  - https://github.com/csu-hmc/gait-control-direct-id-paper

- [2 hr, Done 0.4 hr] Draft an outline and what figures tables should be
  present.

  - https://github.com/csu-hmc/gait-control-direct-id-paper/blob/master/outline.rst

Last week's issues
==================

Quiet Standing Identification Paper

- The bias comparison plots did not come out completely as expected.

  - https://github.com/csu-hmc/inverted-pendulum-sys-id-paper/issues/1
  - We would expect that the ratio of platform acceleration to process noise
    (reference noise in this case) would be the primary independent variable
    when looking at relative error in the gain identification. But I'm not
    getting that as a result. It seems like there isn't a clear relationship to
    the ratio. I'm not yet sure if I have a bug in my code or if it is correct.
  - I was expecting the error in the identification of the gains to remain
    constant with respect to platform acceleration in the indirect
    identification results, but that also was not the case. It seems to have
    the same properties as the direct identification. Again, I'm not sure
    what is going on here.

- I'm not sure what to make of the relative gain error vs measurement duration
  plot for the indirect collocation method. I don't get very consistent
  results. I would have expected the curve to be smooth and have some trend,
  likely error decreases with increase in duration. But it is erratic, so I
  need to manually check the solution on these.

- [5 hr, Partially done 1 hr] Finish computation speed results.

  - Started implementing this code. Shouldn't take much more.

- [5 hr, Did not get done] Try a set of initial conditions with each method and
  compare which ones converge and which don't.

This week's objectives
======================

Yeadon Paper

- [5 hr] Fix as many issues as I can and prod others to do so. Our self-imposed
  deadline is the 23rd for the revision.

Perturbed Data Paper

- [1 hr] Draft out the response to reviewer #3.
- [5 hr] Fix as many issues in the alloted time.

Quiet Standing Identification Paper

- [5 hr] Finish computation speed results.
- [5 hr] Try a set of initial conditions with each method and compare which
  ones converge and which don't.
- [10 hr] Get some draft text down for each section in the paper to work from.
  First draft deadline is end of February.

Gait Control Direct ID Paper

- [5 hr] Draft up an introduction.
