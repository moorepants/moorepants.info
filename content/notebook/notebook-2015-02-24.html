Quiet Standing Identification Paper
-----------------------------------

- [6.9 hr] Submitted abstract to ISB TGSC: https://github.com/csu-hmc/ISBTGCS2015-abstract

Software Carpentry
------------------

- [26 hr] Prepared for and co-taught my first Software Carpentry two day
  workshop at UC Irvine to ~50 grad students and post docs. It went very well
  and we received a lot of positive feedback. FYI: The city of Irvine and
  Orange County lived up to their reputations. I'd highly recommend avoiding
  the place at all costs. But the UC campus was pretty nice and the students
  were cool, they shouldn't be blamed. The only other positive was finding the
  Persian section of town with authentic food and groceries.

Last week's issues
==================

I've gotten little to no feedback on the perturbed data paper and the direct
collocation parameter id paper from Ton and Sandy over the last months. I would
like some responses to my emails and Github issues or either clarification on
if, what, and how they all plan to contribute further. (Ton and Sandy, sorry to
write that in third person but please let me know what's up.).

Also, I spent too much time with Software Carpentry stuff and didn't get as
much research done as planned.

These were half finished or not finished:
