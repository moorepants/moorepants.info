Last week's accomplishments

Job Search

- [5 hr, Done 3.4 hr] Finish teaching statement draft and ask for reviews from
  Rebecca, Sarah, and Cass.
- [1 hr, Done 1.5 hr] Request reference letters for lecturer position.
- [1 hr, Done 1.5 hr] Second interview with robot/machine learning company.
- [0.5 hr, Done] Respond to Sherm and setup a day to do the coding test for the Opensim
  job.
- [2.5 hr, Done 3 hr] Meet with Prof. Kong at UCD about post doc.
- [9.7 hr] Interviewed with sports biomechanics startup.
- [30 min] Turned down the opensim job.

Last week's issues
==================

Perturbed Data Paper

- [5 hr] Fix as many issues as possible in the alloted time. (20 days
  left till due date).

  - See below. Didn't make time.

Quiet Standing Identification Paper

- [20 hr, Failed] Finish first draft by February 28.

  - I went for some spontaneuous itnerviews in the bay area instead of meeting
    this deadline. I did get some work done but managed to booger the direct
    collocation solutions by trying a "better" input perturbation. I think this
    threw off the scaling. I'm going to generalize the scaling so hopefully it
    works. I was trying to have a sum of sines with a human scale bandwidth
    with decreasing amplitude vs frequency for a realistic "random" input. Got
    some tips from my old PI on this.
  - I also updated some of the paper, but the results are still lackluster.

Job Search

- [2 hr] Make a new CV version that focuses on teaching and service.

This week's objectives
======================

Perturbed Data Paper

- [5 hr] Fix as many issues as possible in the alloted time. (20 days
  left till due date).

Quiet Standing Identification Paper

- [20 hr] Finish first draft by end of week.

  - Introduce optimal random input.
  - Generalize scaling.
  - Create plot to show the optimal step size in direct collocation.
  - Rerun the 10,000 identifications with the optimal step size.
