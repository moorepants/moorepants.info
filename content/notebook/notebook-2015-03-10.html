AIO for March 10, 2015



Last week's accomplishments
===========================

Quiet Standing Identification Paper

- [0.6 hr] Worked on packaging opty for conda.
- [4.9 hr] Tried to animate the SVG with matplotlib and worked on the PyDy 3D
  animation.
- [3.7 hr] Specified the acceleration inputs more precisely based on some other
  papers.
- [2.6 hr] Worked on getting the scaling to work with the new acceleration
  input.

Gait Control Direct ID Paper

- [4.1 hr] Got the repository running and updated all source code to GATK 1.2.0.
- [5.5 hr] Started on the draft and made pretty good head way.
- [0.5] Worked a bit on speeding up the inverse dynamics.

Yeadon Software Paper

- [1.4 hr] Finished up all tasks for the second revision and now waiting on the
  typesetters to publish.

Last week's issues
==================

Perturbed Data Paper

I didn't get to any of the issues this past week. I'll be finishing that up
this coming week now that the deadline is here. There is only one issue that
may take some time. One reviewer requested that I update the meta data notes
for all of the trials with extra information. I'm not sure I need to do that.
Any thoughts on it would be appreciated:

Quiet Standing Identification Paper

I did not finish the first draft because I've been hung up on dealing with
problems that arose when introducing a "better" platform input specification. I
got hung up, so I worked on the gait direct id paper instead. I still would
like some feedback on the issues I've posted about this.

The problem this week stemmed from changing the platform acceleration input to
a slightly different sum of sines. I use a 12 sine wave logarithmically spaced
in frequency with random phase shifts from 0 to 2 pi and a linearly decreasing
amplitude wrt to frequency. This is not much different than my original input
but IPOPT doesn't converge as easily nor as quickly with an initial of all zeros
(it does converge when the initial guess is the measure states and zeros for
the gains). I'm thinking to move away from an all zero initial guess as that
was originally in place just because it worked. In practice you will always
have some estimate of the state to use in an initial guess.

This week's objectives
======================

- [2 hr] Create plot of relative error vs dc step size.

Gait Control Direct ID Paper

- [10 hr] Get all of the basic plots in place in the paper.
- [5 hr] Flesh out the results writing more for a first draft.

Yeadon Software Paper

- [0.5 hr] Paste in the reviewer responses into the commenting section on the
  journal website.

Job Search
