Last week's issues
==================

Gait Control Direct ID Paper

Discovered oddities in the DFlow generated marker data that I never noticed.
The fast inverse dynamics routines exposed them. The DFlow mocap module outputs
a 'TimeStamp' column and a 'FrameNumber' column. I was under the impression
that the FrameNumber column corresponded to a frame from Cortex which should be
guaranteed to be delivered at 100 hz. And I thought the TimeStamp column is the
DFlow computer time that DFlow records each time it gets a frame. The TimeStamp
in the mocap module is the only way to syncronize with the TimeStamp column in
the data collected in the record module. But it seems DFlow doesn't maintain
100 hz on the TimeStamp and that frames will stack up, i.e. multiple frame
numbers will have the same time stamp. All of the calculations in the
GaitAnalysis Toolkit relied on the fact that the TimeStamp was reasonably
reliable, but now I don't think it is.

Yeadon Software Paper

Still waiting on them to post the final version. Chris sent in the copy edits.
