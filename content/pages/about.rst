So you want to know about me. Well, I'll tell you one thing about me. When I
turned sixteen, I inherited a 1977 Plymouth Arrow from my grandfather, Garland
(Runt) Moore, "Pop" to me. He inherited this car from his son, Keith, who
passed away about a month after I was born at the age of 23 from some nasty
cancer. I was named after Keith; my middle name, that is. The seats in the
Arrow were black vinyl and would get super hot in the summer time, as would the
engine. But that sure was a fun little hatchback car. I painted a giant
Autobots_ symbol on the hood and hooked up some ear deafening speakers to pump
out the glory of the punk rock music that I'd recently discovered. It became a
portable stereo system for the skateparks and skate spots around southern
Piedmont Virginia and northern North Carolina. I used to ride with my grandpa,
Pop, in that car when I was young. After we were seated, he'd always turn to
me, pat me on the left leg, and give my leg a mighty squeeze with a big grin on
his face. He didn't say much, the stroke and all, but even though that squeeze
hurt like the dickens, I'd smile back and expect one every time I got in that
car. Too bad he didn't make it till I was sixteen and would have been in the
driver's seat, where I could repay the love.

I hail from Dixie_ where the moonshine flowed like water and our summer nights
were spent chasing lightning bugs through the tobacco fields. I skateboarded my
way through high school and moved to the big city of Norfolk to learn some bits
about machines and equations. After attempting to race small formula cars and
sitting in tunnel traffic all too many hours, the bicycle entered my life. What
an amazing, even perfect machine. After the military shrouded city started to
get old, I dropped the car and made my way to the `bicycle capital of the
United States <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis,_California>`_ out in sunny
California. Little gold was to be found, but lots of like minded folks were in
abundance. `The Bike Church of Davis <http://daviswiki.org/bike_church>`_ was
my first calling, after running from my Southern Baptist upbringing. I got
ordained as a Reverend and somehow in my spare time obtained a Master's and
Ph.D. about balancing on bicycles. Senator Fulbright sent me to the `Bicycle
Capital of the World`_ where I lived in a squat called the Poppehuis which
freed up rent money for me to indulge on Belgian beer and couchsurfing all
around Europe. My fondness for engineering carried me further to many other
countries in the world to learn from our most resourceful tinkers, makers, and
thinkers. After postdoctoral limbo working on powered leg prosthetics I'm back
in California at my alma mater working to breath some life into engineering
education.
