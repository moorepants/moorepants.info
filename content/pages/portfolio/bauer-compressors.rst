I worked at `Bauer Compressors`_ in Norfolk, Virginia as an intern for the good
part of a year. I mostly spent my time creating solid models of existing parts
with Autodesk Inventor. At first, I drew hundreds of compressor hose fittings,
but eventually modeled several full sized compressors to help build the
company's common CAD parts database. After modeling all these things, I got to
do some design work making mounting brackets, resizing air tank storage
containers, and developing a passive oil/air separator. I unfortunately lost
the screenshots of all of my material from Bauer except these two images of the
first compressor that I modeled. John Dwyer was my immediate supervisor and can
vouch for my work there.
