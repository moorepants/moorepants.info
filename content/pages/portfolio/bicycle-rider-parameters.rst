To accurately model the bicycle and rider system, the basic physical parameters
of the bicycle and the rider must be measured or estimated. These parameters
include the geometry, mass, mass locations, and mass distribution of all the
bodies in the system at the most basic level and but may include any other
constants such as frictional coefficients, damping constants, etc. Starting at
TU Delft with Jodi Kooijman's tools and methods, I refined a technique for
measuring both the bicycle and rider's basic parameters.

- `Download <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/BicycleParameters>`_
- `Documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/BicycleParameters/>`_
- `Source Code <https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleParameters>`__

PhysicalParameters
------------------

This is the original implementation of BicycleParameters that I created to learn
Python. It isn't well documented, but available for historical sake.
