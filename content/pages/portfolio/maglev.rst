In the early 2000's Old Dominion University made a deal with some company that
claimed they had the latest, greatest maglev train technology. They installed a
track at the University and mounted a vehicle that didn't actually work and
then bailed. Some of the professors in the mechanical and aerospace engineering
deparments decided to `try and fix it <http://ww2.eng.odu.edu/maglev>`_. I was
employed to help finish up a solid model of the vehicle's space frame, as seen
below. We used Autodesk's Mechanical Desktop for the modeling and I had to
measure everything by hand to reverse engineer it because the company that
built the thing supposedly had no drawings of the machine.
