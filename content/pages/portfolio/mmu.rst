The Mobile Ministry Unit is the Davis Bike Collective's mobile tool station
that is used for publicity, events, and cargo hauling. Ted Buehler created it
in 2007 as a trailer and `it went through several different forms over the
years <http://daviswiki.org/Bike_Church/Mobile_Ministry_Unit>`_. Peter Wagner
worked on two of the transformations too which were really fun. Matt and I went
to India in 2010 and returned inspired to transform it one more time into an
Indian style cargo rickshaw. We spent several weekends and evenings modifying
an existing tricycle frame with a new flat bed. `Photos of the transformations
and our build session

give an idea of what went on.
