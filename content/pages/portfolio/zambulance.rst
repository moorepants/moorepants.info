Appropriate technologies for the disabled in Zambia.

In the winter of 2006 I attended Ralf Hotchkiss's `wheelchair construction
class`_ at SFSU to prepare for a trip to work with a wheelchair center in
Lusaka, Zambia. I worked with Kurt Kornbluth, Jessica Vechakul, folks from MIT
D-Lab and the Disacare team to develop a bicycle ambulance trailer, the
Zambulance_, and improve wheelchair manufacturing tools in Lusaka, Zambia.
