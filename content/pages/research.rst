My research is centered around the general topic of human mobility. I work on
vehicle and assistive device design, simulation, analysis, and control of human
locomotion and manually controlled vehicles, and engineering computation
software development. I lead the Laboratorium of Marvelous Mechanic Motum and
advise graduate students in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Graduate
Program at the University of California, Davis.
