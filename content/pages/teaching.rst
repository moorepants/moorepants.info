I am an Assistant Professor of BioMechanical Engineering at TU Delft where I
focus on instruction in a number of courses, curriculum design and improvement,
accreditation assessment, and innovation in engineering education. Below you
will find various links to my teaching related activities including my teaching
philosophy and materials for the courses I teach and have taught.
