{% mark excerpt %}

We measured the kinematics of a bicycle and rider during typical riding and
maneuvers on a treadmill using motion capture technologies. Our main findings
came from analyzing the data using principal component analysis to characterize
the dominant motions in control.

Data
====

Motion capture data from three subjects performing a variety of maneuvers and
different speeds can be downloaded from Figshare.

The software used to process the data for the publications can be found here:

https://github.com/moorepants/MotionCapture

It includes Matlab and Python analysis scripts and an interactive Matlab GUI.
