{% mark excerpt %}

During my post doc at Cleveland State University, I worked with Ton van den
Bogert and developed methods to identify the human's controller during gait. We
developed both direct and indirect identification methods and methods for
identifying a gain gait scheduled controller for planar walking. The motivation
was to develop a controller that could possibly be used in powered lower
extremity prostheses, such as an exoskeleton.

This Python package provides various classes and functions for dealing with
typical gait data, e.g. marker and force plate time series. It contains a
module that parses and organizes the data outputs from Motek Medical's
products.

opty
----

``opty`` is a Python library for optimal control and parameter identification
of dynamic systems. It is capable of large scale problems, such as
identification from tens of minutes of gait data.
