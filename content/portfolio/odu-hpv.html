For my senior project at `ODU <http://www.odu.edu>`_ my teammates and I
designed a human powered vehicle to race in the annual `ASME HPV competition
<http://www.asme.org/events/competitions/human-powered-vehicle-challenge-%28hpvc%29>`_.
This project came out of my new found interest in bicycling everywhere instead
of sitting in Hampton Roads auto traffic and appropriate technology. There also
happened to be a guy in my class that I always saw riding around in a long
wheelbased recumbent. I approached him about the project and the rest was
history. We ended up doing pretty good in competition. I documented most
everything on the `team website <http://www.lions.odu.edu/~dlandman/hpv/>`_.
