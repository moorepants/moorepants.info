Research Statement
==================

:Author: Jason K. Moore

If one word could represent what bridges my research concepts and
intentions, it would be "human". My predominant interests are concerned with 
how humans interact with and can be described as machines, 
with a mechanical engineering focus. Although past decades of mechanical
engineering advancement have made great strides in automatic control and machine <--instrument?
design, this body of research often neglects the intimate association between
humans and machines. 

##Below: really long confusing sentences. I changed some to make shorter & more concise. 

As more complx devices are developed, the relationship between the machine and the human controller
becomes more intimate. The machine must be more aware of its environment, especially the human's
actions and intentions. Such a relationship results in a system where the higher human cerebral control 
is complemented by the computer's massive data parsing and repetitive task abilities. 

##sentense is awkward, tried to fix + adding better transition

If we are to optimize this symbiosis and thus develop more sophisticated instruments,
we must improve our understanding of how humans use machines to better interact with their surroundings. 
Such advanced technologies have recently come to light including: self-driving
cars, assistive aircraft control, haptic feedback, and human-aware factory robots. 

##I feel this is repetative. Possibly nix.
The more we can understand how the human behaves the better these devices can be designed to compensate 
for human weaknesses.

##also, a concluding sentence that goes back to your comment regarding how mechanical engineering still neglects
the intimate association between humand ans machines. Is research still lacking even thought there have been
big strides like the self-driving car? What's missing?

My doctoral dissertation focused on the human's unique ability to balance a
mostly unstable vehicle, the bicycle. 

#fixed a bit
The bicycle is an interesting machine requiring constant human interaction for it to 
balance and stay on course. This (what? this intimate relationship? Interdependance? 
Not really great to start sentence with just "this")
makes the bicycle an ideal platform for investigating several facets of complex human control 
and complementary machine design, all in a
tractable, economically viable, and socially familiar machine (object??). 

##this sentence comes out of nowhere. Need a transition. Also too long. Maybe nix this whole paragraph.
On-board data
acquisition has improved dramatically with the advent and rapid growth of micro-
and nano-scale sensors paired with data collection abilities in small devices
such as smart phones, which is helping to propel engineering into the realm of
big data. These technologies allowed me to collect substantial amounts of
kinematic and kinetic data from both the bicycle and the human subject in
maneuvering experiments. 

##how about just: I collected substantial amounts of kinematic and kinetic data from both bicycle
and human subjects in maneuvering experiments using on-board data acquisition.

I made use of a combination of first-principle
modeling techniques and grey box system identification approaches to develop
realistic models of the bicycle and the human control behavior. Detailed
bicycle dynamics and control research can be found in my dissertation
<http://moorepants.github.com/dissertation>`_ and a series of journal and
conference papers listed in my resume.

experimental sub-disciplines including:

Miscellaneous

   - Human powered machines

My future research directions will leverage collaborative initiatives to fill
gaps in my expertise. I want to develop a more holistic research plan centered
on the human as a controller and his/her interactions with machines. In
particular, collaboration and connection to the fields of machine learning,
neuroscience, and cognitive psychology will be a priority because the prediction
of human behavior while interacting with a machine requires greater
understanding of the human mind and internal control scheme complexities.

My primary goal will be to assemble a team of scientists (students, post docs,
and fellow colleagues) to tackle fundamental concepts in our understanding of
the human control system and the machines with which a person interacts. The
applications are wide ranging but the research will focus primarily on the
basics of human motor control from simple balance to manipulator control and
vehicle control. I want to push the boundaries in understanding how to utilize
human physiological feedback signals in automatic control systems and, in
particular, to increase the automatic controller's operator "awareness".

Questions I plan to seek answers to include: Can machines become aware of their
surroundings so that they never harm a human? When does the automatic system
take control of the vehicle if the human isn't up to the control task? Can
automatic control constantly be aware of the human's state such that it can
adapt to the human's ability or inability? Automatic control of manually
controlled systems must be able to augment the human's actions both enhancing
their ability and filling in when the human loses the ability to be an adequate
controller. It should be aware of the environment when the human cannot be.

During my tenure as a graduate student researcher I gained a great deal of
experience in organization, project management, student mentoring, and
successful grant writing. For example, I closely mentored six graduate students,
and numerous undergraduates in a lab setting. The final years of my graduate
work were funded by a National Science Foundation grant (`# 0928339
<http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0928339>`_), which I played a
large role in writing and managing under my principal investigators, Dr. Mont
Hubbard and Dr. Ronald Hess. Before the NSF funding, I was also awarded a
Fulbright to the Netherlands from the Department of State, which is a very
competitive individual grant. Combining those with successfully obtaining many
university-level grants and co-writing two successful Google Summer of Code
grants has made my experience at obtaining funding very strong. Furthermore, I
am a very active participant in service to academics in my field of study and to
my department and university. I have organized and chaired conference sessions,
been elected to the scientific committee of my sub-field's main conference, and
developed broad relationships with my fellow researchers all at the graduate
student level. My role as a co-founder of the Davis Open Science group has
allowed me to participate in many panels and meetings on topics such as Open
Access at the university level. I feel fully prepared to pursue and secure
funding to manage a large lab with many simultaneous research projects all the
while serving in academic leadership positions.

Research Proposals
==================

I plan to conduct research that will fundamentally change our understanding of
human/machine interaction. The following synopses describes areas where I see
the most potential for impact.

Manual Control and Human Machine Interaction
--------------------------------------------

I plan to explore the human as a machine controller for very fundamental
problems. For example, current understandings leave much to be desired when we
ask fundamental questions such as "How do we balance a broom stick on our hand?"
To answer this question, we need to consider the fundamental sensory information
that we take in, how we process that and produce the correct control action.
Developing experiments involving such input/output relationships with simple
machines can help expose the essence of human control which will have broad
impacts for understanding more complex scenarios such as operating a spacecraft.

In contrast to simple systems and first-principles modeling constructs, the
collection of a large amount of varying dynamic data from force, kinematic, and
physiological sensors combined with machine learning and system identification
will allow for the development of predictive models of human control behavior in
both simple and complex tasks.

Balance
-------

One of the most fundamental control tasks we accomplish, as human, is postural
balance. Balancing is learned at a very young age; a task that initially
dominates computations in areas of the frontal cortex. This later becomes a
learned skill as much of the computation moves to the more reactionary portion
of the brain towards the spinal cord. I plan to to study details of postural control
and the way we learn the skill through carefully crafted collaborative
experiments with neuroscientists and psychologists that can expose the sensory
motor control the human uses in balancing.

Single Track Vehicle Dynamics
-----------------------------

Single track vehicles such as bicycles, motorcycles, and unicycles offer a unique
platform to study and understand human control. These vehicles limit the
human's input sources to affect the vehicle's behavior which allow for more
controlled input/output experimental relationships. Furthermore, the vehicles
themselves have non-trivial open loop dynamics which provides a rich system for
exposing the human's unique control abilities such as non-minimum phase,
instability, disturbance recovery, and directional/tracking control. This
research can have impacts on basic human operator control theory and on the
design of the vehicles themselves, for improved safety and optimal
characteristics for maneuvering.

Vehicle and Machine Handling Qualities
--------------------------------------

When humans interact with machines, whether it be flying an aircraft or playing
a video game, the operator has a subjective opinion of the ease of control. For
example, does the machine do what I want it to with minimal effort? Although
machine performance during a manually controlled task and the machine's open
loop dynamics can be objectively measured, there must be connections between the
subjective feeling and these objective measurements. Unlocking this connection
will allow for the design of machines that complement the human in a passive way
by changing their open loop dynamics through machine design.Furthermore, if
knowledge of handling qualities is combined with automatic control the machine
adapt to the human's desires without modifying the vehicle's physical design.
But developing theoretical models that describe a machine's ease of control will
take an interdisciplinary approach that involves an understanding of dynamics,
control, neuroscience, and psychology. Topics of this nature dominant research
in human factors, but the link to vehicle design and engineering is still weak.
I plan to strengthen that link with collaborative research in this area.

Bicycle and Motorcycle Tire Modeling
------------------------------------

The rigid body dynamics of bicycles and motorcycles have advanced enough for
relatively good prediction abilities, but the most glaring deficiency are models
that can accurately predict the ground reaction forces between a tire and the
rolling surface. I am interested in collecting large amounts of tire force data
using the latest ob-board kinetic sensing techniques to acquire data in normal
driving behavior (i.e. not on a tire testing machine). This data will be used to
create data driven models and identify parameters in first principles models.

Open Vehicle Model and Simulation Database
------------------------------------------

The creators and developers of the world wide web have caught on to the big data
movement and it is beginning to drive prediction and analyses on a grand scale.
For example, Google and Facebook, rely on the ability to parse massive amounts
of data and make predictions of their users' behavior. But much of the
engineering world is still behind the times when it comes to big data. It is
obvious that the more data we collect about systems in the world, the more
realistic and predictive our models can become. We now have the capability for
data driven models and predictions of physical phenomena by making use of vast
database stores and cloud powered computing resources. It is critical that the
field of engineering as a whole embrace this movement, make data sources widely
accessible, and enable these disruptive technologies for the benefit of society.
All of my future work will have a data component that supports these ideas, but
in particular I plan to start an initiative of sharing data in the vehicle
dynamics field.

Scientists and engineers create a variety and large quantity of dynamic models
of vehicles. In the field of research that I have dedicated my graduate work to,
there are well known models like the "bicycle" model for cars, the Pacjeka
automobile tire model, the Whipple bicycle model, the Sharp motorcycle model,
etc. As it stands, these models are relatively inaccessible because either the
model is not detailed enough in an accessible manuscript or, maybe more
importantly, the software to produce the model is not open source and/or
requires special permission for use. This current unavailability of free and
unhindered use of these models detracts from the scientific community's ability
to trust and reproduce results. This issue can be mitigated by embracing open
data methodologies. A large database that allows models to be developed,
submitted, and validated for easy reuse will allow models to be validated
against data on a much larger scale. I plan to start with vehicle models, but
this concept can extend to any system described by differential-algebraic
equations. I plant to build on other open modeling languages and standards, such
as Modelica, to provide some of the framework needed to make this a reality.

Furthermore, dynamic data is constantly collected on different vehicles but is
generally only stored locally on scientists' computers. If there were an easy
way to store time series measurements with accompanying meta data, a large
online database of simulations could be built up. This would allow modelers to
validate their models against thousands and thousands of simulations. In the
fields I work in, most models are accepted after being validated on only a tiny
set of data. Imagine if you could validate your model on huge datasets of
simulations.

I intend to develop an open (i.e. liberally licensed) database with both vehicle
models and simulation data which will provide easy and open access to both
submit and query the desired data. This system may very well be able to be
expanded to any research field that works with similar data types.

Open Source Software
--------------------

The academic needs powerful cutting-edge computation tools at his or her
disposal. Especially in academia, I believe these tools are best provided
through open source software collaboratively developed among leading scientists
and primary users in the field. The nature of open source software parallels
the idea of reproducible, reusable science. I have spent a great deal of time
working on open source software and it is tightly knit into my research. I
would like all my research to have open source software as an integral
component. Some specific examples of projects I have worked on and have in mind
are given below:

- Dynamics (problem development, simulation, and visualization)
- Symbolic equation of motion generation for dynamic systems
- Control Systems
- System Identification

I am interested in developing reusable, highly tested open source software
suites that leverage cloud computing resources to solve computationally large
problems in my field, but that is general enough so that researchers from many
other fields can make use of it and contribute to it.

Human Inertia
-------------

I would like to develop more realistic mathematical models for estimating human
inertia. Current rigid body models do not accurately model the human inertia
around the joints when in arbitrary configurations. The need for more complex
volumetric equations defining the flexible regions around the primary joints can
increase the accuracy of human inertia estimation in arbitrary configurations.
These models which have low computational and measurement latency should be
validated against more precise and resource intensive measurement techniques
like MRI and vibration mode analyses.

Human power
-----------

Humans are power generators and there are many ways to efficiently make use of
the human's mechanical capabilities to do work. Humans have long used tools of
various efficiencies for agriculture and food processing. Making these processes
most efficient is still important for much of the developing world.
Improvements in efficiency of tasks such as transporting people and goods,
moving water, grinding raw foods, washing clothes, etc. are all possible. But
also with the advent of extremely low power electronics (less than 5w) the
human's excess power can potentially keep devices like cell phones, pace makers,
and small computers powered. I intend to study these aspects of human power
generation and develop dedicated summer enrichment programs for students to
develop appropriate human powered technologies for both the developing and
developed world.

Energetics of Transportation
----------------------------

Transportation research and modeling techniques do not always take full
advantage of the predictive ability of the laws of motion. Utilizing
simulations of dynamically constrained systems can add great insight in
understanding transportation systems and giving results that are useful to
engineers, planners, and policy makers. The following lists some of the topics
that I have worked on and plan to in my future research:

- Speed limits per vehicle kinetic energy
- GPS controlled speed limits
- Self driving cars
- Efficient route choices based on the energetics of travel
- Fuel economy feedback reformulated with energy economy in mind
